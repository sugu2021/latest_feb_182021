      'title':`Five Easy Ways to Grow Your Remarketing Ad Campaigns`,
      'overview' : 'Remarketing converts potential clients into customers',
      'content' : `<p>Remarketing converts potential clients into customers. Statistics indicate that a remarketing ad is 76% more likely to be viewed than a regular display ad. While people want to make ads relatable to various audiences, they may come across as being either generic, or cliched. However, remarketing ads are more specific and creative as they aim to convert viewers who did not choose your product in the first instance. Hence, the strategy behind the design is significantly different for a remarketing ad. Here are five ways in which you can make the most of using remarketing ads and expand your customer base:

      </p>
      <p><b>Use all marketing platforms </b></p>
      <p>Similar to initial marketing, remarketing must also be creatively delivered using various platforms like Google, YouTube, etc. Using multiple forums will enable you to create a successful campaign directed at the people who have expressed interest but did not complete signing up as your customer. It also enables the delivery of specific content such as promotions, which motivates people to click on your landing page. You can send emails if the potential customer has shared his/her/their email id with you.
      </p>
      <p><b>Show the viewers what they like</b></p>
      <p>Use internet cookies effectively to ensure that you show the potential client how your firm’s product matches the viewer’s personality and tastes. For example, displaying a range of gadgets that the person is interested in increases the chance of the customer opting for your e-commerce site. This way, you can motivate successful conversions by customizing your remarketing endeavor according to the viewer’s needs. To address the people who abandoned your site in the process of purchasing your product, use a call to action and inform them that they have stopped the transaction process at the cart stage.
      </p>

      <p><b>Use coupons and deals</b></p>


      <p>The second strategy to get people to sign up through remarketing involves providing them with attractive deals and offers. This is most prominent in the case FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), in which, a 24-hour sale will push the viewer to make the plunge and become your customer. Similarly, distributing coupons and offering engaging deals will bag your customers, as today’s e-commerce is dominated by comparative shopping. Hence, hosting attractive offers will ensure that you stay on the top of the ladder and also make sure that you do not lose your potential customers to external competition.

      </p>

      <p><b>Complement their products</b>
      </p>
      <p>While understanding remarketing, you must remember that your existing customers could change allegiance at any point. Hence, remarketing is a continuous process in which you continue to provide services that interest and benefit your existing customers. This can be done by showing complementary products; for example, if the customer purchases a mobile phone on your site, it is unlikely that he or she will purchase another phone in the near future. However, you can use this opportunity to sell them complementary products like phone covers and protection glass, which they might require for their phones.
      </p>

      <p>Remarketing is a constant process of digital marketing, which is sure to not only bring in more customers but also maintain healthy relations with existing customers as well. </p>

      <p >It’s story - the narrative that is unique to it.
      </p>

      <p><b>But we are not the regular Story tellers of your Brand.</b></p>

      <p>You heard it right. At BrandStory we do not get carried away with the idea of just stories. Implementation and the aftermath (literally the after-math i.e Analytics) matters a lot here.
      </p>

      <p>BrandStory is a creative agency that recreates a brand by identifying its story and crafting a suitable narrative. In today’s day and age, where established brands have a plethora of brick-and-mortar stores as well as a dominant online presence, other brands also need coherent branding and narrative building initiatives to exhibit the different sides of their personas. There are intriguing stories to be discussed at every touchpoint and we’re here to articulate these narratives!</p>

      <p><b>What makes us the storytellers that we are?</b></p>

      <p>Storytelling is an art designed to appear at the right time in the right place. The right story hits home! To ensure every story has an impact on its intended audience, our framework is simple. We first determine our larger potential, the different services that we shall look into for considering all the varied places a user connects with a brand. Our partners and collaborators, who are from diverse creative and business backgrounds, help us create compelling stories and take business-driven decisions for the brand. From brand strategists to visual artists, we love to confer a unique character to companies, people, or ideas. At BrandStory, we have come together due to our passion for stories and how they are intertwined with brands.</p>


      <p>
      <b>All speak and no show? Stories take life with our services. Digital Marketing, UI/UX, Design, Website Design and Development and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are the core services we offer.
      </b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Digital Marketing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brands are no more the portrayal they show on a television commercial or a billboard; they are now about what they ‘speak, feel and look like’ every time you connect. Digital marketing essentially encompasses the different touchpoints of a brand in a digital space - from search engines, website, social media to emails, mobile applications, etc. At BrandStory, we believe in pushing the limits through organic community-building for a brand by telling stories in different mediums and varied touchpoints.
      </p>

      <p><b>UI - UX</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is essential for brands to understand their audiences well. User experience (UX) research is all about understanding the user at every step of their journey, from gaining awareness about the brand to using the interface and following through with the call to action. User experience, research aids the different decisions that a brand needs to take. The user interface (UI) design is based on UX research and helps in determining how the user will navigate various web interfaces and the kind of story or narrative that is going to reach them at each point. From a holistic view of the brand, we work on the navigation approach while wireframing every single point of interaction as well as further prototyping and testing it!
      </p>
      <p><b>Website</b></p>
      <p>The World Wide Web is a densely packed space today. Your brand needs to outshine all the digital clutter. Brand presence in diverse relevant mediums is essential and it all starts with a website. A potential consumer should feel inspired by and drawn to the story on the brand website before they become a consumer of your service or product. All narratives and stories scattered around different touchpoints. Including social media should only intrigue and your website is where it should fill all the missing parts of the puzzle. From the web copy to the graphical expression, development, and functional aspects - each needs to be designed for your target consumer and should tell them a story that brings them back!</p>

      <p><b>SEO</b></p>
      <p>As contemporary storytellers, we are equipped with more than our flair for words and images - we understand algorithms as well. The trends in search engine optimization (SEO) are constantly evolving today - from voice search to machine learning and personalization of sources for audiences. SEO also helps in determining how audiences behave as well as what they want and seek. Creating brand awareness or securing better rankings on a search engine is no longer about flooding your digital spaces with hashtags, keywords, and building links. Improvements in artificial intelligence have made it crucial for stories to be compelling and well-rooted. </p>

      <p><b>SMM</b></p>
      <p>Social media channels began as promotion and connection platforms but today they have become the storytelling mediums. Brands reveal their different aspects of social media platforms, forming communities of their own with large groups of like-minded people. Storytelling over social media channels is essentially all about consistent storytelling from a brand’s authentic voice. People today get to see beyond the facades, the glam, and glory. They see what happens behind the scenes, they question the actions of a brand and the intent too. Authentic brand stories make a difference and we’re here to write them for you.</p>

      <p><b>Mobile</b></p>

      <p>Smartphones with their revolutionary visual concepts are creating narratives in their ecosystems. Brands have become a part of this ecosystem in many ways - whether it is through social media, brand apps, or other interactions. Storytelling through mobile marketing is an imperative part of the brand experience since this is where consumers spend most of their time today and they want to be constantly engaged. Content is going ahead by leaps and bounds, and personal curation is at its peak now - and it all runs on brand stories. The time for pushing your brand through explicit advertisement is over - today it is about the story you are trying to tell the world.

      'overview' : 'What started as a doubtful journey by Amazon and Paypal',
      'content' : `<p>What started as a doubtful journey by Amazon and Paypal, has now become one of the most successful phenomena of the century. E-commerce has had an upward trajectory of evolution since its creation. E-commerce websites today are not just a product of intense market research, but also a product of changing client needs. Just as the online marketplaces have brought up revolutionary changes as per the customer requirements, the customers themselves have adapted to the changing market scenario for consumer goods. </p>

      <p ><b>What are some major e-commerce trends that are influenced by client needs?</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Beyond Geography:</b></p>

      <p>One of the most revolutionary changes in e-commerce marketplaces has to be global transactions. Seamless supply chains and the power to pay globally without currency being the problem has made many small scales and domestic online businesses evolve on a global level and reach a colossal customer base. Customers too are loving the unparalleled freedom of choice they get from shopping via international websites.
      </p>

      <p><b>On Palm Click:</b></p>
      <p>Mobile purchasing has given a whole new dimension to the world of e-commerce. These numbers are enough to show the impact of the increased mobile using habits of the customers on the evolution of e-commerce websites.</p>

      <p>It is not only easy to reach a customer through a mobile website, but it is also easy for the customer to order anything on the go through their mobile phone. It is an evident fact that desktops are now out of fashion and the number of customers shopping from their desktops has significantly decreased. </p>


      <p>
      <b>What role does social media marketing have to play in the evolution of e-commerce websites?
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>As far as the evolution of e-commerce websites is concerned, economic and human behavioural characteristics are the only two significant things that are causing a constant flux in the field. The revolutionary social media marketing tactics now inculcated in the business expansion plans of e-commerce websites are solely triggered by the increased usage of social media by the customers. Over the past two decades, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest have seen a dramatic surge in the number of regular users.
      </p>
      <p>Taking the e-commerce marketplace to these social media platforms was a very obvious step in their evolution. Majority of online businesses today are spending a huge fortune on social media marketing and some of them are even launching their sites from their social media accounts.
      </p>

      <p>It is quite obvious that the evolution of shopping spree is going to have a powerful impact on the virtual world of e-commerce. Many new inventions in the field of e-commerce marketplaces are a result of anthropology and customer satisfaction.

      'overview' : 'Two search engine giants, Google and Bing, have been dominating the web advertisement world',
      'content' : `<p>Two search engine giants, Google and Bing, have been dominating the web advertisement world. Facebook, the uncrowned king of social media platforms, follows them closely behind.</p>

      <p >Google had a total market share of 91.7% in January 2010 and its market share, as of January 2019, was a staggering 89.9%. Bing had a market share of 3.5% in January 2010, rising to 3.99% in January 2019. Among social media platforms, Facebook leads with 65.88% of the market share [1] [3].
      </p>

      <p>Google Adwords offers a search-engine driven marketing platform, allowing advertisers to target their customers by means of showing advertisements on the basis of a keyword search. Internet Explorer has Bing as the default search engine, which facilitates connecting users and advertisements on the browser. Facebook allows its advertisers to utilize data based on demographics, location, psychographics, and the interests of its users.
      </p>



      <p>Google, Bing, and Facebook have their own share of regular users; each uses a different strategy of advertising. Therefore, a clear winner is difficult to ascertain.
      </p>

      <p><b>What’s more?</b></p>
      <p>The specialty of Facebook ads lies in its efficacy to create brand awareness as well as in its ability to launch a new product to unknown audiences. With over one billion active users every day, Facebook’s reach in terms of regularly engaging audiences with the latest advertising content is unmatched over social media platforms.</p>

      <p>Google Adwords, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the target, re-target, and engage new and existing potential customers. A number of recent studies, in fact, have shown that Facebook ads often lead to a transition to Google searches. Once customers see Facebook ads, they might want to explore more about it over a Google or Bing search to perform a little more research. Statistically, Google dominates search engine volumes with around 3.5 billion searches each day [1].</p>


      <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>

      <p>There are abundant examples today which suggest that the companies that have utilized Facebook, Google, or Bing for advertising their products have achieved excellent results.
      </p>
      <p>Facebook is, without a doubt, the top choice for B2C advertising with its reach and retention capabilities, with dominating the marketing share on the social media end [1]. Presently, Google searches have started to 'decide' the advertisements that are shown to users. Bing ads, on the other hand, provide comprehensive content and leave a longer impact on the minds of audiences, which can be proven by the fact that the Click-Through-Rate (CTC) of Bing ads was 34% higher than Google Adwords [2].</p>

      <p>Each option comes with its own benefits and helps various businesses around the world.</p>
      <p>Rather than opting for a single option, companies can use the ad-space in each of these platforms, by focusing on the strong suits of each of the platforms for a superlative outreach.

      'content' : `<p>Email marketing is a viable and relevant marketing tool for businesses, brands, and marketers alike. Email marketing campaigns are driven by multifarious business strategies. In order to succeed, you must have your own checklist while planning your email marketing campaign.</p>

      <p >Email marketing mistakes have been aplenty, even in the case of seasoned marketers. Ask them and you’ll find horrifying anecdotes about wrong senders, continual email bombarding to the wrong target group, missing out on key details, bad links or poor images, typos’ in content, and lots more! Avoid such situations and get your email marketing campaign right with the right checklist.
      </p>

      <p><b>Subject Matter</b></p>

      <p><ul>
      <li>Relevancy of Subject Line to the Database is the most important factor to account for. Craft subject lines relevant to your business goals or current marketing objectives. Do not waste the time of your customers</li>
      <li>Instead of bombarding readers with multiple products and services, you should choose the ones which are currently being highlighted by the company or the flagship offerings. </li>
      <li>Check for a personal touch throughout the mailer that has a relaxed and user-friendly tone while encouraging a call to action or comment.</li>
      <li>The email marketing campaign should have a clearly defined goal/subject</li>
      <li>There should be a subject line which attracts people to click on it.
      </li>
      <li>The names of the sender and the brand should be clear along with the return email address. </li>
      <li>There should be replacements for the default images and text in the email marketing template.</li>
      <li>There should be working links which have been embedded into logos, images, and other links/buttons.</li>
      <li>The call to action should be clear there and should be in sync with what you are trying to get your readers to do. </li>
      <li>Make sure that you have proofread your content and that there are no typos or spelling/grammatical mistakes.</li>
      <li>Short sentences should be used in order to make the message clearer and complicated industry jargons should be avoided. </li>
      <li>The preview text should be optimized properly. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p><b>Technical Aspects </b>
      </p>


      <p > <ul>
      <li>Check for permissions and send to double opt-in or opt-in contacts only. </li>
      <li>Have an unsubscribe or opt-out option that can be easily availed by readers.</li>
      <li>Check whether you have segmented your contact list on the basis of their requirements and other interests. Email marketing list segmentation is really crucial in this regard in order to target the right audience. </li>
      <li>Make sure that the preview functions properly on tablets, mobile phones, and desktops/laptops.</li>
      <li>Always have test mails dispatched to a testing list across multiple email clients. </li>
      <li>The preview should be functioning for multiple email clients as well.</li>
      <li>The pre-header should be suitably made as well.</li>
      <li>Rendering has to be suitably done for dynamic text/images. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <br>
      <p><b>Time Management</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>The email marketing campaign should be scheduled properly in terms of time and date. </li>
      <li>Make sure that special occasions or events are properly highlighted in your campaigns if relevant at the right time without being overtly late. </li></ul>
      </p>

      <p>Following these steps ensure an optimal result in the consumer front, and makes your marketing campaign stand out from your competitors.</p>
      <p>Email marketing campaigns have to be absolutely impeccable since reports state that a large majority of potential customers will naturally hit the unsubscribe button since they get fed up with a deluge of emails from one brand. Agreed, email marketing offers great returns, but only if done right. The above-mentioned checklist will help you navigate email marketing campaigns with care while ensuring that you increase and retain your customer base without putting them off.

      'overview' : 'Concentrated effort towards building trust and relationships ',
      'content' : `<p>Concentrated effort towards building trust and relationships and portraying a professional appearance are the key components in Website Design for B2B companies.</p>

      <p >Areas that need to be winning in a B2B website are:</p>

      <p><b>Content:</b> Decision making in B2B companies are complex. Gathering vendor information, vetting service providers, mapping market price and standards are few of the many processes that can prolong the otherwise long decision-making process.</p>

      <p>It is necessary to portray detailed information on the website and in the form of white papers, case studies, and industry reviews while establishing expertise to scale your reputation. Marketing success also depends on informing buyers in all stages of a purchase lifecycle about your products, experience, skills, and services.
      </p>

      <p><b>User Pathways:</b> B2B websites usually have to cater to different user groups, from small to large sized companies, across different departments, functions, and roles. It is important to ensure that there are distinct user pathways for different stakeholders who have different goals and needs and to direct them with appropriate menu options to their desired page. Confusing user pathways that add cognitive load on end users seldom make it past the trial period.
      </p>


      <p ><b>Product Details:</b> The products involved in B2B activities are usually complex, expensive, and part of a larger system. Hence, it is important to provide specific technical details to understand if it fits with the client’s existing system. Good B2B websites give information about products, the standards and certifications, compatibility with other machinery, technical support, software, etc. to enable the client to know how the product is compatible with and benefits their own system in the long run.
      </p>


      <p><b>Focus on Lead Generation:</b> B2B websites focus on lead generation over getting high volumes of visitors to their website. It is essential to make Calls to Action visible to induce users to submit their details which can then be used to generate leads. This is an important step to ensure online marketing success for B2B firms.
      </p>


      <p><b>Functional Design:</b> B2B firms need to convey professionalism and expertise. Using functional and minimalistic designs convey seriousness while conveying relevant information for B2B firms. This creates an uncluttered experience that is also easy to navigate while directing focus on the features of the product rather than the user interface of the website itself.
      </p>

      <p><b>User Personas:</b> B2B website visitors are from different departments, roles, and functions, and may even be from different industries. Hence, content and navigation must consider different user personas and provide relevant information for different user needs. Decision makers such as managers may require information regarding costs and outcomes, whereas, actual users of products may be concerned with only product features and benefits. Helpful navigation and content based on different users highlights the attention to detail, which justifies the relatively higher cost of B2B products.
      </p>

      <p>A B2B website design should targets specific user personas, showcasing the product features which are tailored, with enough flexibilities, to suit specific needs of end users. Add to that a focus on lead generation and with enough traffic, you have a B2B website which aids a company's marketing efforts.

      'title':'All You Need to Know about Voice Search Optimization',
      'overview' : 'With giant leaps in technology, how people use their devices to search for information',
      'content' : `<p>With giant leaps in technology, how people use their devices to search for information online is undergoing a rapid change. There is prominent use of voice search across multiple forums like Siri in Apple Devices, Google Voice Search on Android and Cortana in Windows. Hence, it is essential for businesses to look at content differently and optimize it for voice search and assistants.</p><p >It is essential for companies to note that voice search is not merely a fad and here are some statistics to prove the same:</p>

      <p>Voice Search stands at the third position on the list of SEO Trends for 2017 and beyond, and one example is the fact that one-fifth of Google’s searches are voice-based queries. This new technology of voice search has made it very easy for a user to gain information from their device on a question-answer basis. It allows interaction with the machine to be performed naturally and conversationally. One can use a simple voice command to get information on the weather, play music, turn on lights, order products or check the weather forecast.</p>

      <p>Now that we know voice search is a crucial SEO tool, the question is how to optimize data for voice search. Historically, people typed relevant keywords on a search engine to find what they were looking for. The first thing to remember in voice search optimization is that unlike keyword phrases in a search engine, voice search is more conversational and natural. It is also flexible and focused. In a nutshell, voice search queries are more prolonged than text questions.</p>

      <p>Here’s a set of advice from experts related to voice search optimization:</p>
      <br>
      <p class="blog-p"><b class="py-3">1. Increase the speed of your page</b></p>
      <p>Though there is no direct link between speed and voice search optimization, fast loading sites have higher a search engine ranking which in turn impacts voice rankings.</p>
      <br>

      <p ><b>2. Use Normal Speech</b></p>
      <p>Digital assistants are engineered to process conversational and straightforward language. Google Data of 2017 shows that 70% of all voice searches on Google use a natural flow of language. This indicates a need for a shift from traditional keyword terminology; if you’re looking for an automobile repair shop use key-phrases like “Where is the nearest automobile repair shop”?</p>

      <br>
      <p><b>3.Use Long-Tail Keywords</b></p>
      <p>As mentioned before, voice search queries are longer than text queries because they are specific. These specific keywords provide an opportunity, even for smaller companies to rank high on Google Search results. For example, a brand that sells antique bronze jewelry and artifacts is more likely to be viewed in a search for “antique bronze jewelry” rather than “jewelry“ as larger companies will dominate the latter.</p>

      <br>
      <p><b>4. Use Location to your benefit</b></p>
      <p>Since most of the voice-based searches are to find information about services ‘nearby’, use the location of your business in all your features.</p>

      <p>Voice search optimization is a trend that grows beyond the abrupt keywords of yesterday’s search engine trends, and a planned and effective use of this strategy can prove to be an immense contribution to the growth of your brand.</p>

      <p>Evolving trends can be quite unnerving especially when they require changes to design and code. Approaching digital consultants, like BrandStory for example, will make the process much simpler. If you’re looking for the Best SEO agency in Bangalore, you have arrived at the right place.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Marketing is an art of convincing consumers to buy the product of a particular brand.',
      'content' : `<p>Marketing is an art of convincing consumers to buy the product of a particular brand. Numerous strategies tactics have evolved to empower brand to attract more customers. Initially, it was only limited to physical campaigns. The advent of digital platforms slowly changed the scenario of companies enthusiastic to utilize the social media networks more for marketing their brand. Now, the trend of solely digital marketing is slowly fading out. People now want the credible physical presence of the company but in an innovative way. That is why it is time to go ‘phygital’ with social media marketing campaigns. The merging of ‘physical’ and ‘digital’ has revolutionized the overall approach toward marketing.</p>

<p><b>Be 'Phygital' because Customers are 'Phygital'</b></p>
<p>The convergence of physical and digital approaches is justified because online users have a real existence and they are to own and use a product physically after all! Thus, live demonstration events are appreciated by the consumers when they experience those through their own eyes. According to a 2013 eConsultancy report, 40% US consumers find the nearest store of a specific retailer via smartphone.</p>

<p><b>Engage the Consumers</b></p>
<p>Users feel appreciated when they are interacted with. You have obviously noticed that the potential customers love it when they are involved in the marketing activity. A 'phygital' campaign should be engaging and engrossing in nature. Planning a contest is an interesting method. KitKat Australia arranged a contest where customers had to buy a product to enter a digitally run contest. This is a very common but effective way of implementing ‘phygital’. You can come up with your own plan but do not forget to focus the mass centrally.</p>

<p><b>Infuse New Technology</b></p>
<p>This is the age of not being technically correct but technologically one-of-its-kind. Users find it fascinating if they can access the digital arena from a physical realm. The Argentinean club called Club Atlético Tigre offered its fans to enter the stadium with "Passion Ticket" on the basis of their excitement level. A RFID microchip was infused in each fan’s body to measure the excitement level via special scanners at every entrance. Implantation of 1000 chip was reported within two days of the campaign launch. 3D projection mapping as a marketing tool has also gained immense popularity as patterns through lights were created on huge geometric structures.</p>

<p><b>Be Quirky</b></p>
<p>Anything odd and weird strikes human eyes very easily. This is the main reason behind the huge success of “The Man Your Man Can Smell Like” advertising campaign. It was started as a television commercial but it became an internet viral because of the quirky way of speaking about unrelated things by the man in the clip. You may choose any one or combine each to create a great 'phygital' campaign for your customer experience to increase your brand value. A prudent mixture of strategies that are backed by research are sure to bring in huge results.</p>`,

      'title':'Accentuate Your Business with Excellent UX',
      'overview' : 'The value of UX is often underrated as companies give more priority to their product',
      'content' : `<p>The value of UX is often underrated as companies give more priority to their product promotion and sales. Better UX design paves the way for better business. Some findings by Adobe inform that the market share of creative design companies is 1.5 times greater and companies that are attentive to design and usability have surpassed their performance by 219%. These striking statistics are enough to rush for building an excellent UX design.</p>

<p>Why UX has to be Good</b></p>
<p>The website is the face of a company on the internet. Most of the users judge a company primarily on the basis of their online interface. If it takes longer than few seconds for a user to understand how a website or an app works, then it loses potential customers. User experience is the most important factor in search engine optimization as well. Google algorithms assesses each website in terms how useful and convenient it is to the users.</p>

<p><b>Appearance Matters</b></p>
<p>A unique presentation of website always attracts eyes which are used to looking through conventional and old designs. For example, earlier a website used to be segregated into some typical pages. Each page was dedicated to a section. The types of pages are still same but the appearance has changed now. Most of the websites let the users see a glimpse of all the pages and let them choose which page they want to go with. The design is another major factor in appearance. For example, as soon as you enter the website of the Feed music, you will feel you are roaming in a cosmic realm.</p>

<p><b>Easy Navigation</b></p>
<p>This feature is very important especially for the e-commerce sites. For e-commerce websites or any website for that matter, it should be looked after that the user can find quickly what they look for and more importantly that should suffice their need. Most of the airline websites have usability issues but Virgin America stands apart from the lot. It is clear with instruction and navigation. One can book a flight without any hassle and confusion.</p>

<p><b>Informative</b></p>
<p>Content is perceived as the king in the website. Each user has the purpose of fetching information while surfing through different websites. Information is infused into content. However, the first two factors play a significant role in letting the users reach to the content. If a user finds it difficult to navigate, then there is fair chance that user would not visit the site again. However, a website should not start bombarding information, right from the Home page – most single paged websites do this. Even too much information does no good if not presented nicely.</p>

<p><b>Responsive</b></p>
<p>Users quite often leave queries and questions on the website. Also, feedback is submitted for a particular product, service or for the website itself. Moreover, your website should be positively answering the question of the users. Unresponsive sites lessen traffic drastically and search engine algorithms send them into oblivion. Thus, design your UX in the best possible ways to provide the most impressive experience to the users and make sure to remain away from stagnancy.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Local business often immerses into oblivion due to poor visibility to its targeted',
      'content' : `<p>Local business often immerses into oblivion due to poor visibility to its targeted consumers. <a href="assets/images/seo-company-bangalore/">Search engine optimization</a> works like a magic wand to clear the fog and let your targeted audience see what you have to offer to them. Usage of smartphones and other devices has increased the count of potential customers who are always online. SEO permutes and combines different strategies and tactics to accentuate the online visibility of a brand or company to your targeted audiences.</p>
<p>SEO comprises different strategies based on the product, location, targeted consumers. Thus, not all strategies are universally successful to transform a business to a treasure trove. You must consult and hire a search engine optimizer to carry out the burden for you. There are certain dos and don’ts which are necessary to follow to make the most out of SEO. Local businesses have a limited budget for marketing and promotion and they should focus on SEO and implement it correctly.</p>
<h4><b>Let’s check out the important dos first:</b></h4>
<p><b>1.Create Google+ and Google place for each location of the same business</b><br>
This is basic and it is better to start off with basic. Google creates a free listing on Google+ and Google Place pages and you have your potentials customers only typing some keywords away. The free listing is displayed along with the search results on both computer and smartphones. Do not keep your customer waiting to find where you exist and then reach you because there is a chance he/she may lose interest in you by the time they finally drop into your business location.</p>
<p><b>2. Bring consistency in NAP listing, citations and on-page reference</b><br>
Local SEO majorly depends on NAP citations or the Name, Address and Phone. Google gives equal significance to them like links in traditional SEO.<br>
Trusted third-party websites such as Yell and UKPlaces are the best place to begin with NAP citations. According to the Moz’s Local Search Ranking Factors Report, out of the six elementary ranking factors, 3 are associated with the NAP citations. While evaluating, the consistency, and the accuracy of the business address, phone number and the business name throughout the online world is judged.</p>
<p><b>3. Infuse local search strategy with Google+ </b><br>
This is an effective way to optimize personalized search. You can make your listing more appealing to your users by adding images, your website link etc.</p>
<h4><b>Now it’s time to know the main don’ts:</b></h4>
<p><b>1. Do not put fake reviews</b><br>
Many brands hire writers to compose fake reviews on Google to boost up the ranking. Faking is an art and such artists are very rare in this world. Your probable chance of meeting them is very low. So it is better you never buy on that and let the people organically come up with reviews.<br>
Encourage your customers to leave reviews on Google and on the third-party websites.</p>
<p><b>2. Never take your online reputation lightly</b><br>
Take care of the customer service you provide, because this counts. All good reviews will add up to the online reputation of your business, but one negative review can ruin everything. It will take a toll on your business, leading to serious effects. Therefore, besides offering an excellent customer service, pay enough heed to your online reputation, rule out any negative feedback with patience and positive attributes.</p>
<p>There are more strategies for your local business, but it is advisable to look for an expert who can suggest you the absolute needs tailored to your business. So think positive, think SEO!</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Blog is a big playground for a writer’s creativity. Each blog post serves a common purpose of boosting the Search Engine ranking of the website. You must be wondering how possibly a blog, a personalized write up can do that! Blog is the platform where you can share information, awareness, knowledge and expertise on your product with the community or with your potential customers. Blog is the best tool to attract your customers.</p>
<p><b>Blog Actively-Make your Presence Feel</b><br>
Google ignores those sites which are left stagnant and unchanged for years together. There are plenty of such sites floating in the spectrum of World Wide Web. The search engines strictly monitors the latest updates of every website. If you post two-three blogs a week, then you are seizing the maximum opportunity of updating your website organically. It symbolises that your blog is active and that it is been taken care of. Search Engines hate idle blogs and websites.</p>
<p>However, the blog content should be potential enough to pull a lot of visitors and spend the time to read it. It must talk about a topic that the search engines can consider worth sending to the users.</p>
<p><b>Add More Pages-Reason to stay longer</b><br>
The more the numbers of pages, the more the search engines crawl across your website. If your website is a mine of excellent blogs and those have gone viral on social media platforms, you will be able to gain more visitors. When these visitors are spending longer time on your blog, it indicates that the blog has some good information that they are interested in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with limited pages in your website, you cannot widen the usage of the keywords, which is the soul of SEO. If that is the case, you may have to stuff your existing content with the same keywords, which is again a threat to ranking in the search engine result pages.</p>
<p><b>Inbound Links to Increase the Authenticity</b><br>
Contents on a blog must have inbound links as references. Search engines identify these inbound links as a vote of confidence. More the inbound links, more visitors spend time in your website for several related information. This increases the authenticity of the website in the eyes of the search engines.</p>
<p><b>Keywords to increase the Visibility</b><br>
Playing with keywords in the blog is a must, and there are enormous opportunities to do this. Optimizing all the blogs with relevant keywords and linking these keywords with inbound links, makes your blog an information mine. When users type same keywords on the Google search box, Google identifies all the pages in your blog containing the keyword, and displays them in the search engine result pages. It increases the visibility of the blog, raises the number of clicks.</p>
<p><b>Socializing your Blogs</b><br>
Once your blogs are updated with new contents, you can share the blogs in the social media sites for engaging more number of people to know about your blog, product and services. As you receive positive comments on the blogs, it adds up to the ranking of your website, because search engines are smart, they gather information from all places about a product, to judge on the parameters of ranking.</p>
<p>Thus blogging is a very important factor playing behind the ranking of a website. You must keep your blog active so that you can keep yourself running in the competition. So start blogging today.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Marketing has considerably changed over the years.',
      'content' : `<p>Marketing has considerably changed over the years. With time, people have started realizing the potential of social media. It has compelled organizations to incorporate the aspects of <a href="assets/images/services/social-media-marketing-agency-bangalore/">social media marketing</a> in the overall mixture of the marketing mix. It was closely observed that social media marketing was mostly grasped by the companies that were B2C. Most of the B2B companies are severely sceptical about the advantages that social media places on the companies. As the B2C companies were the ones to adopt this marketing within a short span of time so it clearly puts forth the difference between the B2B and B2C marketing.</p>
<p><b>Let us have a look at some of the distinctions between social media marketing of B2B and B2C companies:</b></p>
<p><b>Content –</b> Content is no longer limited only to words, it has been oriented to visual, audio and interactive content these days. The messaging within the social post is now treated to be content. Content is solely the provider of value to the reader. While B2C marketers come up with creative contests, GIFs, videos and more interactive content, the B2B marketers, on the other hand, focus mainly on the professional type of content. B2B marketers mainly make use of certain types of content which can be explained in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>White papers or eBooks- whitepapers were observed to serve a plethora of advantageous purposes for all the B2B marketers. It can be stated that whitepaper is one of the greatest tools of the lead generation which is a great goal or objective for the B2B marketers. In the course of providing information to the reader, people are more willing to access the details.</li>
<li>Case studies- These are also an effective tool for a lead generation which proves to the target that the product is a suitable choice for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Channel –</b> With the proliferation of the social channels, people are observing the niche of the social network that focuses on the forms of communication. Some of the effective channels for B2C are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook- it is a standard and the first social channel which turned out to be the most effective. It is an excellent tool for engagement, promotion and customer support.</li>
<li>Instagram- with this channel, visual content becomes an incredibly effective tool for the B2C marketers. Selfies are a good choice.</li>
<li>Youtube- Creation of fun and interesting videos makes the B2B marketers grab the attention of the viewers. The polished videos give more personality to the company.</li>
<li>Twitter- Having a Twitter account is really handy for real time updates and with the use of hashtags, companies become a part of the trending conversations in various out of the box ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For B2B:</b><br>
There are mainly 3 social networks which can be focused by the marketers that are LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. These channels are leveraged not only for the purpose of engagement but also for the distribution of content.</p>
<p>The dichotomy clearly states the differences between the social media marketing of B2C as against B2B. it can be stated that both B2B and B2C marketers are utilizing the benefits of social media marketing at its best.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Any product’s appeal (and therefore its sale) that your company has put up for its consumers basically depends on two criteria',
      'content' : `<p>Any product’s appeal (and therefore its sale) that your company has put up for its consumers basically depends on two criteria –</p>
<p>1. How user-friendly and satiating it is at its usability.<br>
2. How appealing and friendly is the packaging/interactive layer that the user uses to utilize your product?</p>
<p>The first factor is a simplified definition of the <strong>UX Design</strong> (i.e, the <a href="assets/images/ui-design-company-bangalore/">User Experience design</a>) of your product, while the latter signifies the <strong>UI</strong>(User-Interface)<strong>Design.</strong></p>
<p>Although these terms are generally used in reference to cyber products (software and apps offering services and solutions), they are not limited to the domain.</p>
<p>An awesome application with extensive features and usability cannot possibly reach the zenith of its potential if it’s wrapped with a weak, unfriendly, unattractive interaction surface. Similarly, even an invoking, arousing, appealing and interactive base cannot sky-shot the sales of a product whose basic layer of application and usability (or ‘back-end’ as developers call it) is flawed.</p>
<p>Thus, both UI and UX design need to go hand in hand to come up with the best end-results.<br>
So, here’s a list of what you as a company could do differently this year to come up with the best UI/UX combo for your users:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the Co-dependence</strong> –The first important thing to understand is how UI and UX intermingle with each other. Pay heed to the para above, let this be a reminder that the efforts are fulfilling only if they meet the requirements from end-to-end.</li>
<li><strong>Know, understand and focus on your audience and their requirements</strong> – Don’t beat around the bush and be satisfied if one of those blows randomly lands on it! Spend time and resources on understanding your exact/targeted user-base and then follow an objective designing methodology catering to pre-decided specifications and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong> – Simplicity preludes an underlying elegance. Your users need to be impressed by the elegance of your product’s design and workflow, not overwhelmed by the complexity of it all.<br>
If you’re designing one of those versatile, flexible and thus, seemingly complex things, try to use as many of those popularly familiar features (for instance, ‘drag and drop’ for computer designs) as you can. Innovate and experiment with implications and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Care to gather feedback, and act on it</strong> – The last one on this list, but probably the most important and often the most neglected as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumer feedback on both UX as well as UI and timely action on it is a necessary iterative cycle that can help you constantly improve your product and services. This not only leaves you better off than before but also helps highlight your goodwill, indulgence and concern amidst the consumer base!</p>
<p>That’s a series of simple resolutions you could take this year to enhance not only your consumers’ experience but also the interface they experience it through.<br>
We wish you a creative and a prosperous new year!</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Ever thought of what would have happened had Steve Jobs thought of the common user while offering double-priced computers, or Rolls Royce thought of reaching out to the general masses while designing its classy cars?<br>
The world might have never witnessed the coming in of the cutting-edge computer technology, or of those super luxurious “Bas Naam hi kaafi Hai” cars – at least in this era!</p>
<p>But what’s the thing that these and countless other similar success stories have in common?<br>
Simply put – A belief!<br>
A belief – in not only their product and its quality, but in the consumers as well ie no matter how offbeat you are, if you have a confidence in your products, then be confident that if presented correctly, the right consumer will come to you!<br>
The same can be extended to the content marketing industry. Seems like drawing distant parallels? Well, wait up!</p>
<p>In the present scenario of having infinite amounts of Search Engine Optimized content floating around (about which users are increasingly becoming aware), what sets a brand apart is its genuineness.<br>
People now know that the link that shows up at the top of the Search Results page isn’t necessarily the thing they’ve been looking for! The aware user acts oblivious to those search engine rankings and does care to scroll down, to find something that has some excellent content to offer in return – that is appealing to him and his needs and not the machine.</p>
<p>So, when you ask a writer to create content for your online handle, that’s meant (in the actual sense) to appeal to people and their needs instead of to a ranking algorithm, he’ll be writing to someone who understands – a human, whose emotions and needs can be appealed to and who understands why the content and wordplay is superior to those who have just used “Peter Patting Potato” or some similar, trivial “keyword” in the write-up 10 times. And thus, all the content on your website is genuine, meaningful and thus appeals to your customers out there who are in the lookout for brands like you!</p>
<p>The benefitting factor with this approach is that only the right consumers who likes what you have to offer, cares to find you in the first place, approaches your organisation – and you don’t get featured on every random search. Well, inshort – genuine leads, isn’t that what we all want?</p>
<p>So, take a stand and go out there targeting your user, and not a machine or an algorithm – for he’s the one you wish to make relations with, not that web page that pops up when you type insignificant search words onto a blank bar.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'In this digital era, maximum businesses have turned to the various digital medium of marketing and have realized the importance',
      'content' : `<p>In this digital era, maximum businesses have turned to the various digital medium of marketing and have realized the importance of this form of media for survival. But the approach required for this medium of advertising is quite different from all others and requires more effort to make it a success. Some business struggle to take full advantage of it due to various reason which differs from business to business.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons why your social campaign has not picked up the pace but let’s have a look at a few common reasons</p>
<p>Firstly, <b>the audience your brand is targeting:</b> Just increasing your followers on the social platforms should not be the main target. If your business is not able to generate the desired sales as expected then check the type of audience your social handles have. There is a high probability that you’re targeting on the wrong platforms. Try to determine what type of social media your prospective customers use and then make your presence felt there.</p>
<p>Once you’re on the right platform and have a sizable number of following, you should<b> keep them engaged.</b> They have some expectations from you, they would want to be regularly updated and this requires<b> consistency.</b> If you’re going through with social media campaign it should be done with full enthusiasm and requires a good amount of investment as regard to time and effort. If consistency is not maintained the customers would feel unwanted and eventually you may end up even losing your fan-base. So, try to<b> maintain a social calendar </b>as to when and what time the updates are to be provided and stick to the schedule or else you can go for <a href="assets/images/services/social-media-marketing-agency-bangalore/">social media marketing company</a> for promotion.</p>
<p>Now that you’re able to engage your audience on the social media platform keep in mind <b>not to over promote yourself</b> as this could result in your followers unfollowing you due to the irritation caused with the self-praise and pushing your products. As they say, too much or too low, both are not good for health so a balance should be maintained to create healthy social campaigns.</p>
<p><b>The type of content</b> posted depends on your goal i.e. Are you trying to get new customers or to get the existing consumers to spend more? So,<b> assess whether the content is in line with your goal.</b></p>
<p>Lastly, <b>keep track of your social media metrics</b> – it is important for the business. The focus should not be on the number of likes and shares your posts have created but the reach and mentions it got and eventually the conversions your social handles are creating. Also, the consumers are more vocal on social media and the growing negative mentions can hurt the business. In the same way, positive feedback from a consumer could be encouraged to spread the good word. In the end, this platform is emerging out as one of the effective media and requires attention as a click is likely to generate more business for your brand.</p>`,

UX stands for “User Experience,” and it is merely the effect, an operating platform leaves on its user. The system could be a website, desktop software, a web app or even a mobile application which everyone uses frequently. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) rating gets higher for a system as the user experience gets better.</p>
<p>A UX Designer is a person who correctly knows what and how a person wants to surf the Internet, and accordingly they design their platforms. The UX designers are concerned with the overall feel of the product. Whether it may be the navigation through the website or simply the color combination, it’s all on the bearable shoulders of UX designers. User Experience designer is nowadays becoming equivalently hired as the programmer.</p>
<p>Before one can see the factors being exchanged for the cost of a fantastic UX design, he has to understand what it takes for a “fantastic” UX design.</p>
<p>The Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovery and Planning-Like all the other good things, UX designers too, start with intense brainstorming and planning. This is Particularly Important as each interface demands ineffably different way of approach. During the whole scene, the difference between UI and UX should be clear.<br>
For instance, UI represents a dating profile, and then UX represents the date itself.</li>
<li>Making a Strategy-A sizable portion of UX designer’s cost is covered in this stage, as it serves as the most fundamental and challenging task for them. It takes a lot of time and designer’s hard work with loads of User research.Thankfully, there are several ways to get the User research task to learn about the user base (good for them!). A significant proportion of UX designers employ the most common practices, which is having surveys, polls, interviews, reviews or focus groups. This process is explained in two pretty sentences but takes a lot to complete (as expected).<strong>This involves;</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>User Surveys and Interviews</li>
<li>Journey and Empathy mapping</li>
<li>Rapid Prototyping</li>
<li>User testing</li>
<li>Define design guidelines</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps are essential in the given order. This stage is a very time to consume and research-oriented (not the ones did in Lab, instead of User research!).</p></li>
<li>Mind mapping the UX- It is the step when the designers, design something (finally!). In this step only, the easy platform of “Shareit” and beautiful navigation panel of the Android gets molded. This stage emphasizes more user usage and reviews and the UX is iterated according to their needs and demands. After all the sham, the users are going to show the response, so producing what they require is the goal.</li>
<li>Final Design-The apparent counterpart of UX (which is not), the UI shows up here. After the skeletal design (UX Design) of the product, the looks of it has to be created. The UX Designer has to dress the prototype with inexpensive but beautiful interfaces.UI completes the whole UX process and provides the marketers their projects of marketing the finished product. The UI-ers have to keep in mind the color theory, typography (thanks to Steve Jobs) and other design elements.</li>
<li>Cost of the UX designers-The words and the steps might look alienated, but actually, the real-time scenario is a little different. The real success of a UX is the user satisfaction that can only come through dedicated work of UX Designers. The Cost of UX designers might look steep, but the quality UX is priceless.</li>

      'title':'Confession of a Digital Marketer - 2017',
      'overview' : 'Social media is a good brand communication channel that breaks down the information about a product and services into a more',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">Social media is a good brand communication channel that breaks down the information about a product and services into a more straightforward but frequent method. As a digital marketer, I have experienced a gradual increase in the social media adoption in a brand’s marketing mix working with about with 400+ brands at various verticals and business sizes, I could see. Predominantly, SME’s see social media as a sales tool over an engagement tool. I don’t deny that Social media platforms can also generate leads, but only at a cost. Now the point is, does an SME has a considerable amount of budget and time to streamline Social media campaigns as a lead generator for their sales funnels. SME’s or startups entering social media as their only lead generation source to support their funnel they might end up in disappointment.</p>
<p align="justify">Digital marketing companies generate content and post it on handles expecting magic in sales and revenues. Many marketers will agree that without a post-boost, the cost spent on content will not see the required reach and engagement. As per a <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/facebook-engagement-brands-publishers-falls-20-2017/" target="$_blank">recent research</a> done by Buzzsumo brand pages are seeing a 20% decline in their organic engagement. I honestly suspect the degrowth of the organic engagement is much more than the findings in the last qtr of the year 2017. I am sure that Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Organic-Reach-on-Facebook" target="$_blank">claims</a> the lower organic reach is because of the algorithm that designed based on 1000 factors that are related to an audience on their newsfeed since its attempt of feeding the most relevant content to the customer.</p>
<p align="justify">Suspecting that Facebook is trying to make more money by forcing the brands to increase the spend per post for a higher reach and engagement? Let’s read their quote in one of their QA’s</p>
<p align="justify">“Is organic reach dropping because Facebook is trying to make more money?<br>
No. Our goal is always to provide the best experience for the people who use Facebook. We believe that delivering the best experiences for people also benefits the businesses that use Facebook. If people are more active and engaged with stories that appear in News Feed, they are also more likely to be active and engaged with content from businesses.”</p>
<p align="justify">I went and looked at a comparison between Q3 2016 Net Income vs the Q3 2017 Net income. There is an excess net income of 2,000 Mn USD comparatively to this year’s Q3 against last year Q3. So the quote mentioned above from Facebook is as innocent as saying Iraq had WMD’s and Donald Trump is a better president.</p>
<p align="justify">The only problem with the dominant social media &amp; search platforms I see is that they consistently are encouraging SME’s across the globe to spend more than the larger brands. Because the smaller brands will spend their money quickly in a day or a week, so the platforms can accommodate as many SME’s to spend their money on them, Also the bid rate increases between the number of people ready to invest for their demography and target audience they wanted to reach. Hence leading to a gradual increase in the budget spent by SME’s every year on year but end up with low return on investment.</p>
<p align="justify">These paid platforms built their revenue engine based on the large chunk of small brands rather than the small chunk of the large brands. Till then we would be coming across similar <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/small-and-medium-business-are-advertising-on-facebook-because-it-is-helping-drive-results/articleshow/58164385.cms" target="$_blank">media articles</a> encouraging SME’s to spend more on their platforms. That reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure" target="$_blank">market failure</a> and the Information asymmetry that helps only these social platforms and search engines to be on the side of benefit.</p>
<p align="justify">So the best possible digital marketing strategy for SME’s is to create strong digital assets and have a consistent, long-term but multi-channel digital marketing strategy which focuses on brand reach and impressions alone. Use all the social media platforms as a free content distribution space where you usually spend ad budget on one or two platforms to increase the reach. Lets honestly agree that sales are the by-product of the effective communication that you usually run through the awareness campaign. The large organizations whom so ever already spending a considerable amount of budget now have to focus on the optimisation of the campaign to have the best possible ROI on the usual quantity of the budget spent. Large organizations have to set goals and map their budget spent against the revenues and the demography of the business for continuous improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">For businesses, it’s important to realize that Social media could also be a place where they can generate leads and sales, but it shouldn’t be the only place where business are trying to establish their sales. It would be a disappointment. And also for brands, Paid campaign is not a long-term solution since the cost of the paid campaigns will increase your overall ad budget year on year which will have a major impact on your margins. So balance your current marketing ad budget spent on both paid and organic campaigns, where paid campaigns will give you the immediate impact you try to create based on the budget, and you always build those strong organic assets to reduce the budget dependency of the paid campaigns in the near future.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'UX is the acronym for the “User Experience”, and it is the experience a person gets while working or surfing through a system.',
      'content' : `<p>UX is the acronym for the “User Experience”, and it is the experience a person gets while working or surfing through a system. The system could be a website, desktop software, a web app or even a mobile application which everyone uses frequently. There is something called the Human-Computer interaction (HCI) rating which gets higher for a system as the user experience gets nicer. User Experience designer is nowadays becoming equivalently hired as the programmer.</p>

<h2><b>Why Is UX Important?</b></h2>
<p>With the rise in digital marketing and e-commerce websites, the user experience is inevitably crucial because this is what turns the user into the potential customer then, eventually a customer. With more ease, a user walks through the system the more profitable the company gets. One of the most common dislikes of any UX design is, ‘They hate advertisements’ especially when they’re intensified on a page.</p>

<p><b>UX Design Execution Process</b><br>
The User Experience Design also referred to as UXD is the process of increasing the customer satisfaction and loyalty by keeping the focus on improving the overall customer pleasure and loyalty between the customer and the product. The User Design Execution should encompass the interactions between a potential or active customer and a company and make it easier.</p>
<p>The UX designers should design the execution process by keeping the focus on User Experience, Advertisers, cost and feasibility reports and design a unique and compatible design. The UX design being a blurry concept can’t be defined in concrete terms, and hence one can’t differentiate the UX designer from the advertiser or the web developer.</p>

<h2>UX Design Execution Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Team</li>
<li>The Design framework</li>
<li>The Design Engineering</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
<li>Validation</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<p><b>The Process</b><br>
1. The Team- The UX Design is not particular to only designers instead of a teamwork between the Designers, the Engineers and Product Managers. The trilogy plays and serves to the successful UX design.</p>
<p>2. The Design framework- Any design process is iterative and should be done by learning the faults and mistakes as we go. The first draft of the design is just to know where actually we’re placing the components of the web page, mobile or web application. The framework generally includes the List Pane, Card Pane, Navigation bar and Cards.</p>
<p>3. The Design Engineering- This step makes sure that if the product provides the right experience or not. If not, then the engineers must improvise or even change their ambitions of the product.</p>
<p>4. Prototyping- In this step, the model of the project is made and is circulated among the top customers; it is often called beta testing. The focus of this stage is to create awareness about the product and mainly to find the shortcomings of the design.</p>
<p>5. Validation- This step focuses on validating the product with different elements. The customer feedbacks are received and validated, and the report for the Revision is made.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion- This is the last step where the UX designers see that if the product is well and can be released to market or requires revision and iteration.</p>
<p><b>UX and Ads</b><br>
The solution is “Targeted Marketing” which is a straightforward concept of ‘showing what they want’. Whenever a person searches something on the Internet, it means either they’re looking for it or just collecting information, and if here the marketers impose their ads the users are likely to buy the product or services.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'User experience and customer experience are more often than not used interchangeably.',
      'content' : `<p>User experience and customer experience are more often than not used interchangeably. However, these 2 concepts are not exactly similar. Let us discuss both of these terms in detail to know how they are different from each other.</p>
<p>Customer Experience is more of an umbrella term in itself. Customer experience is a larger concept as compared to the user experience. It has been gaining importance of late and finding a place in managerial vocabulary. However, just like it is very difficult to define terms like “design” and “creativity”, interpreting this phrase is not that simple. Customer experience is the experience that a customer has whenever they interact with a certain company or brand. It defines the how the relationship is between a provider and user of the product. It is the product of an interaction between an organisation and a customer over the duration of their relationship and comprises of customer service, advertising, brand reputation, sales process and product delivery. Customers respond differently to direct and indirect contact with a company. The overall experience reflects how the customer feels about the company and its offerings. Customer experience is the one thing that could effectively differentiate you from your competitors. Better the customer experience the more customers you retain. But, not many people engage in its practice. Why though? Simply because it is a very complex process. Creating a great customer experience requires enormous amounts of collaboration across groups in a company that often work independently. Working together can be a herculean task if you are very used to working singly and that’s what makes the framework for customer experience so challenging.</p>
<p>A company looking to improve its customer experience needs first to understand the layers that this concept is made of. Firstly, the client’s journey needs to be analysed, touch points need to be provided to support their journey with the company, and lastly, an in-depth study of the ecosystems integrated with the products and services that the brand offers needs to be conducted to devise a customer experience strategy. All these, if followed in the right direction, will definitely give best results to the companies.</p>
<p>User experience refers to a person’s perceptions and responses resulting from the use or the anticipated use of a product, system or service. What is the difference then between user experience and customer experience? User experience is a subset of customer experience. In essence, if you added up the sum of all knowledge on each individual user experience, you would be able to explain your customer experience. Examples make everything comprehensible. Say you download a new software. However, when you access it, you find it to be very confusing and difficult to operate. This would mean a bad user experience. However, they have a helpline, and an operator explains to you step-by-step as to how to run the software. This would mean a good customer experience. So while user experience may be one part of customer experience, it is very essential and cannot be overlooked. </p>`,

      'title':'Have you heard? A Bad User Interface Is a Cranky Receptionist',
      'overview' : 'Whenever you enter an office, a hotel or any other organization,',
      'content' : `<p>Whenever you enter an office, a hotel or any other organization, your initial contact happens with a receptionist, maybe young woman in a formal skirt or a man in his thirties wearing a tie. Naturally, the impression that you make of the receptionist is the impression you make of the organization. It is a common belief that receptionists are supposed to be polite, have basic knowledge of the organization and can ruin your entire visit if they are rude. Similarly, a user interface is your contact to the world of binaries and codes.</p>
<p>It is the medium through which you interact with and understand your everyday devices. And a bad or a confusing user interface means difficulty in operating the devices. There are some qualities which are shared by great receptionists and user interfaces.</p>
<p><b>1. Clarity-</b> This means the interface makes everything clear through language and visual elements. A receptionist who is clear in her language and gestures is better than the one whose speech is unclear.</p>
<p><b>2. Concision-</b> In order to make sure that everything is transparent to the user if the interface is loaded with information and has labelled things that don’t need to be labelled. As a result in a heavy intake to the user. The key is finding the balance between being concise and still being clear.</p>
<p><b>3. Familiarity-</b> In the era of a million options, the users deal with a lot of interfaces. So even though it is necessary for the interface to be clear and easy in its own way, it is also important that some basic features remain the same.</p>
<p><b>4. Responsiveness-</b> When a receptionist doesn’t respond to your inquiry about a spare key card, it’s simply annoying. Similarly, when an interface doesn’t respond to the user or provide a feedback of the ongoing process, it is bound to leave the user in confusion.</p>
<p><b>5. Consistency-</b> Keeping the interface consistent throughout the application or the website would help establish a pattern in the user’s mind. Like you would remember a specific organization if all their receptionists greet you in a particular uniform manner.</p>
<p><b>6. Aesthetics-</b> While the interface can work without icing on top, it won’t hurt to make it look appealing, especially if it lasts in the user’s mind.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficiency-</b> A good interface works efficiently, containing possible shortcuts and quick responses to the user’s queries.</p>
<p>Your interface is the agent through which your users will know about your product. And if the users like your interface, they are very likely to remember it and associate your website or application with it. A good user interface can even make the user get habituated to it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a bad user interface, which doesn’t have the sense of familiarity to other interfaces and is not able to clarify its responses to you, is like a cranky receptionist whose language is not clear to you and you wish to leave the organization as soon as your work is done!</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>It has become a small world, indeed. But how did this transformation happen in the first place? The advent of information technology began with computers and laptops; however, today it has a taken a new turn, getting a boost with the increasing production and sales of smartphones. Be it searching for an address on Google maps or internet banking, people today prefer using their smartphones for fulfilling almost every task.</p>
<p>Hence, businesses today must tap into the potential of such consumer behaviour and make the most of it. Websites today must be attractive, interactive and user-friendly, and must be easy to view and use on all kinds of mobile phones- be it android or i-phone.</p>

<h2>Five Mobile Friendly features for web designs</h2>
<ol>
<li>The convenience of navigation</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Touch ID</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is a list of five most important mobile-friendly features one must keep in mind while designing a website-</p>
<p><b>1. The convenience of navigation-</b> Earlier, navigation points on the website were kept hidden until it was required by the user. However, today, the scenario has changed. A simple and clear icon layout is all that the customer looks for since it will help him or her to go through the site in lesser time which will enhance the consumer experience.</p>
<p><b>2. Background-</b> All websites have a particular theme which their customers are familiar with. Hence, it is important that the images and backgrounds of the website are either blurred or diffused in order to maintain the familiarity with the users and at the same time, also make the interface mobile friendly.</p>
<p><b>3. Colors-</b> Aesthetics of the website is what the user will first notice, so it has to be attractive and catchy. However, while developing a site for mobile phones, it is important to incorporate enough white spaces since users tend to go through sites more quickly when they are on their mobile phones. Hence, don’t overuse colors but place them wherever necessary.</p>
<p><b>4. Animations-</b> Adding functional animations to websites makes them more interactive, user-friendly and proper usage of good animations can really help users get a more enriched experience with better visualizations and communication.</p>
<p><b>5. Touch ID-</b> This is a new trend. This is basically a technology to ensure security. Many websites, today, are incorporating Touch ID into their design for mobile websites. This will help increase user experience and trust since security is an issue of extreme importance for most cautious customers. This will definitely help them trust your website, and hence they will be able to rely on your services, even when it comes to payments and transactions.</p>
<p>Besides these most important points, it is also necessary to understand that things such as creating an intuitive interface, ensuring wearable technology, good swiping functionality and provision of location services also matters and can affect consumer experience immensely. Also, companies must keep updating their websites to keep up the pace with the latest trends. They must continue creating interesting web interfaces and content for mobile phones as more and more people today have access to phones and use it for the majority of purposes as it offers them both speed and convenience. It is becoming a responsibility for businesses to ensure enhanced consumer experience by making a good website which must be mobile friendly.</p>

      'content' : `<p>User-friendly UX design makes using the software easier and a smoother experience. It follows that having a user-friendly UX design will result in higher profits than from using an unintuitive interface. The distribution and usage of unintuitive software was the norm in enterprise software. This was accepted as the industry standard until the consumerization of enterprise software. With enterprise software becoming a consumer product, competition sprung up, and unintuitive enterprise software was a thing of the past, as company employees could now choose between competing or standard software products just like a customer. Teams had the freedom to choose their software experience from competing offerings.</p>
<p>As a rule, the better the software functions, the better the business functions.<br>
UX design can be implemented by way of two methods, namely, by having an in-house UX design team OR partnering with a <a href="assets/images/ui-design-company-bangalore/">UX design agency</a>. Both these methodologies have their own merits and shortcomings. Let’s explore them, one by one</p>
<p><b>Advantages of having an in-house UX design team</b></p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of having an in-house UX design team, some of the top ones are:</p>
<p><b>Dedicated Team</b>: Having an in-house UX design team gets translated to a team that is fully committed to the process of UX design of your product, from start to finish, including catering to every modification as well as providing the most nuanced solution, as required by the organisation.</p>
<p><b>Domain Knowledge:</b> An in-house UX design team that has been working with the organisation for a number of years will have an in-depth knowledge of the domain of the organisation as well as the software product that they work on.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholders:</b> An in-house UX design team working near stakeholders becomes an integral part of the organisation, hence understanding the value of the project and giving it due attention.</p>
<p><b>Cultural Impact:</b> An in-house UX design team will be impacted by the work culture of the organisation they are working for. This will allow the culture to permeate their design and implementation philosophies, making the product feel more natural and intuitive for the end user of their product.</p>
<p><b>Consistent Experience:</b> Any organisation prefers a consistent user experience across their products. Having an in-house UX design team ensures that the same design philosophies are implemented across a range of the goods, creating a consistent user experience.</p>
<p><b>Flexibility:</b> An in-house UX design team provides flexibility in conception as well as the implementation that allow for customisation of the user experience, suiting the organisation’s requirements.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages of an in-house UX design team</b></p>

<p><b>Establishing Domain:</b> Once a team is assembled, it is important as well as tedious to establish the team’s domain in the organisation.</p>

      'overview' : 'What is the first thing that you notice when you visit a website?',
      'content' : `<p>What is the first thing that you notice when you visit a website?</p>
<p>Let me guess, its visual appearance, right?</p>
<p>Visual presentation comprises everything from font to the color scheme of the webpage. Colors leverage the power of your text or content. Psychologists have revealed that people have a propensity on a subconscious level to color impressions. Colors have great ability to generate Impact on viewer’s mind, as a result, make the visitors stay longer or shorter. We all know- longer the visitor will stay more the chance to cajole them with the content.</p>
<p>Colors have their own language of emotions that also differs from countries and cultures. Colors are divided into three sections, namely primary, secondary and tertiary colors. Primary colors are the basic colors that cannot be produced by mixing colors, while the secondary color can be formed by mixing primary colors and tertiary colors are formed by mixing secondary colors. Here are some general colors with their general meaning:</p>
<h2>Role of Colors in Designing the Website</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blue, it is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, faith, wisdom, confidence, intelligence and truth.</li>
<li>Black often represents elegance, wealth, sophistication and mystery.</li>
<li>White symbolizes peace, purity and simplicity.</li>
<li>Orange brings a feeling of warmth, enthusiasm or warning.</li>
<li>Red is associated with strength, power, love and desire.</li>
<li>Green can represent nature, life, renewal and energy.</li>
<li>Yellow indicates happiness, freshness, clarity or optimism.</li>
</ol>
<p>But how to use these colors while designing a website? Colors are used in such a way that it triggers the positive consumer emotions. It acts as a non-verbal tool of communication. No formula or concept can help you to choose the right color. Here are some things that we can consider in determining the colors that can positively influence your visitors:</p>
<p>Focus on target audience,<br>
Concentrate on the product,<br>
Background color,<br>
Text should be clearly readable,</p>
<p>Firstly ask yourself, which feeling you want in your audience that will trigger a positive emotion in them towards your product. According to that emotion, select the suitable colors.</p>
<p>The next thing you can do is identify a color that suits your product or that will excite the consumer towards your product. Red associates with high energy or desire, so if you aim to excite the consumer about a product, apply at least some touch of red on your web page. On the hand, blue signifies trust, loyalty or faith, so if you want to cajole the audience with your product, like insurance policies or credit card schemes, then spray some blue on your web page. Black is also a promising color on web pages, it is generally used on art related web pages due to mysterious behavior, in some cases it motivates audience to execute the purchase. Black is also used as font color on majority of websites as it is comfortable to read.</p>
<p>Let’s conclude, colors act as non-verbal binding tool, which imprints the first impression on the audience. So the color combination can play a pivotal role in setting the emotion of the audience. Though it may not completely solve your problem, but if it would have impressed the audience than the audience will be bound to go through the content. This is how colors play a role on webpage, and the rest depends on your content and ability of product.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Nowadays when there are a million websites that cater to the need of the user for any particular piece of information, a system is required to filter and provide the best-suited link. This is achieved by Search Engine Optimisation or SEO. An SEO makes a national or international search to come up with a list of websites by an ascending order of rank. Now it is widely known that site’s popularity or income depends on the number of pings it gets. For this to happen, it is essential for the website to remain higher up in the ranks. And this is achieved by writing SEO friendly content. As with everything, there are ways to make the content better by following certain steps or guidelines. Below are certain aspects that should be kept in mind while writing.</p>

<h2>5 Guidelines for writing SEO friendly content</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use of keywords</li>
<li>Research into the content</li>
<li>Style of writing</li>
<li>Provide links for required information</li>
<li>Review of the article once written</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1. Use of keywords: </strong><br>
Keywords are the instruments that recognize your content in a search. These are the words that are the user’s type in the search engines. Therefore, whenever anyone is writing these keywords should be researched and be mended in the piece. But the interesting thing is that too many keywords put together vaguely will only lead to loss of quality. Hence, the keywords though important should be managed with efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>2. Research into the content:</strong><br>
The content that is displayed on the websites is for both the reader and the search engine. Thus the quality of the content should not falter in any manner whatsoever. It definitely should not be a couple of keywords strung together to form some coherent lines. The content should sufficiently answer all queries that anyone might have regarding the searched issue. For this thorough research has to be done by the person writing it so to include as much information as possible lucidly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Style of writing:</strong><br>
The style of writing is what will keep the interest of a person that opens the website. It should be assumed that a reader has the attention span of a few seconds only. And these few seconds are the only window to impress that particular person. Long, tedious articles should be avoided as much as possible. The paragraphs need to be short and interesting. Bullet points, heading and subheadings can also be used to give more information concisely. In addition to this, it is vital that the content remains juicy and crisp.</p>
<p><strong>4. Provide links for required information:</strong><br>
This facet can gleam from one of the most popular platforms in the world which is Wikipedia. Wikipedia not only provides you with a write-up of the information but also links and sub-links to information wherever possible. This is because you cannot assume a reader to believe everything you say or narrate. Proof should be provided as much as possible to convince the user and give the website a seal of trust.</p>
<p><strong>5. Review of the article once written:</strong><br>
No matter how much proficiency one may have in typing, it is not harmful to give it a read up once. As any typo or any inconvenience for that matter lowers the traffic in a website. It shows a certain degree of incompetence on the part of the writers and the editors. Moreover, it is only logical to spend a few minutes revising the work rather than lose faith with the readers.</p>
<p>If you follow the steps mentioned above, you will get the SEO content that works the best for you.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Every User-Experience designer faces a definite problem of creating a typical design for different users. While keeping the needs, expectations, and preferences of the various types of users in mind, the UX designers struggle to design their platforms. They are constantly in the hunt for the common trait among their audiences for creating better design interfaces.</p>
<p>One of the most common dislikes of any user with any background is “They hate advertisements”, especially when they are intensified on a page. The different types include text, video and interactive ads, which come in a pop-up, auto-playing and banners formats. The ads are the revenue generator for mostly non-e-commerce websites and blogs, and hence they use them exhaustively.</p>
<p>It can be clearly seen the advertisements are detrimental for User experience and a challenge for UX designers. There is apparently ‘No way’ that UX designers could abscond to the Advertisement Conundrum. But they believe that if Advertisement count is commensurate with User experience, then it’ll be a successful Interface design.</p>
<p><b>Symbiotic relationship between Ads and UX design</b></p>
<p>In 2000 there were about 361 million people online, and in 2016, 3 billion with the growth rate of 761% and about 0.8 of every mobile user has Internet Subscription. People spend around 3 hours per day online in average making Internet the obvious market, today.</p>
<p>Marketers exploit Display ads, Social media, E-mails and Search engines to market their products and services. Today, one can’t expect returns from Television, Newspapers and yellow page ads because they are outdated. People don’t have time to listen to one-way communications and more often get offended.</p>
<p>Today, Television is replaced by websites like Netflix; Radio is amended by replacing satellite radio commercials, Newspapers with news websites or mobile apps. Even Online marketing faces a threat by many elements like browser plugins (for example, ‘Adblocker’) which thrashes out all the pop-ups and banner ads, thereby enhancing the User experience.</p>
<p>The crux of both the worlds rests on answering the same questions: for whom it is? And what do they value? This implies there should be an understanding between UX designers and advertisers which is the only way to lend some positive results for them and the users; this is the “Symbiotic relationship”.</p>
<p><b>Leading Hands in hand</b></p>
<p>The seemingly possible solution is “Targeted Marketing” which sounds ineffable but is simple that is ‘showing what they want’. Whenever someone searches something on the Internet, it means either they’re looking for it or just collecting information, and if here the marketers impose their ads the users are likely to buy the product or services. It is “intelligent marketing” and wonderful User Experience. ‘Neither all Ads nor website is perfect for everybody’ so it all depends on developing in response to suggestions and feedback.</p>
<p>Today, they are; UX designers and marketers, who they will be tomorrow?</p>
<p>The future of online marketing and UX designing doesn’t seem to be distinct and exhaustive; rather it seems to be a unified one which might be called, say, “creative technologist” or “UX marketers”. It might sound anything but is surely going to demand the professional, the knowledge of online marketing and UX design. Today, the UX and Online marketers could seem incompatible with each other, but if they want success, they have to create the ‘Symbiotic Relationship’ among them and lead together.</p>`,

      'title':'6 Little things to consider while designing UI',
      'overview' : 'A good User Interface (UI) designs are the blend of simplicity, usability, visibility, feedback and reuse principles.',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">A good User Interface (UI) designs are the blend of simplicity, usability, visibility, feedback and reuse principles. The main objective of UI design is to create designs which are user-friendly, accessible and efficient. It’s about anticipation users deep-seated needs and goals and how they will react. As quoted by Hillman Curtis ‘’The goal of a designer is to listen, observe, understand, sympathize, empathize, synthesize, and glean insights that enable him or her to ‘make the invisible visible’’ reflects the user-centric approach of a UI design. While designing a UI following listed points must be considered.</p>

<h2>6 Little things to consider while designing UI</h2>
<ol>
<li>Content Layout</li>
<li>The user is the king</li>
<li>Accentuate the Visual clarity</li>
<li>Visual Consistency is the key</li>
<li>Smooth Navigation</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Optimising Typography</li>
</ol>

<p><b>1.Content Layout</b></p>
<p align="justify">It’s one of the most important factors in UI designing. A well-balanced, clear and aesthetic content layout helps users to easily find out what they are looking for.</p>
<p><b>2.The user is the king</b></p>
<p align="justify">Placing users in control of the design so, that they can perform a variety of customising features like giving users ability to reset choices or program defaults, redo or undo choices.</p>
<p><b>3.Accentuate the Visual clarity </b></p>
<p align="justify">As the users have small attention span designs with more clarity is essential. UI designs affect how users perceive it. Gestalt Principle deals with how human perceive patterns, organisation and form called as collection of visual perception has helped designers to clearly communicate ideas properly through the effective management of shape density and whitespaces. And by meticulously playing with shape density and whitespaces, designers bring about visual clarity. Grouping items on a menu or list, using heading and prompt text or numbering items makes the design gives more visual clarity.</p>
<p><b>4.Visual Consistency is the key </b></p>
<p align="justify">Consistency is important for UI designs as it brings about user’s engagement. Visual consistency is how the elements are placed in a UI design. Lack of consistency makes design chaotic and out of order and design appears confusing to the users. Visual consistency can be achieved by<br>
1-Proper use of Whitespaces.<br>
2-Use of right contrast for all elements like colours, shape, size etc.<br>
3-Sustain the User’s task i.e maintaining continuity.</p>
<p><b>5.Smooth Navigation </b></p>
<p align="justify">Navigation should be clear, easy to use, sans complexity and user-friendly. It’s is all about clickability — make almost everything interactive. The placement of action choices on the page impacts how people respond. Clarity in navigation helps the user to stay more on the site and thus low bounce rate.</p>
<p><b>6.Optimising Typography </b></p>
<p align="justify">Typography optimisation also optimises UI. UI is mainly text-based and focuses on readability. Font size, width, texture, arrangement of the text and colour are the crux of UI design which affect UX as these increase the readability and scannability of the content.</p>
<p>For designing a remarkable and user-friendly UI try to consider all the above points for a positive outcome.

      'overview' : 'Just as the building of an architectural masterpiece requires a strong foundation, it is imperative to develop an efficient user interface for a master-class experience for the user.',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">Just as the building of an architectural masterpiece requires a strong foundation, it is imperative to develop an efficient user interface for a master-class experience for the user. After all, the website of your company is where you communicate with your customers and indulge in interactions. It is, therefore, necessary to have a user-friendly interface that facilitates good interactions in the virtual world. It is the user interface that is the magnet for the customer, and everything else stands next in the queue. Let’s delve a little deeper to know how to build an effective user interface.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks to build Effective User Interface</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use the User Perspective</li>
<li>Feedback will facilitate</li>
<li>Size matters</li>
<li>Tradition and Modernity</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Keep it Simple</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Use the User Perspective</b></p>
<p align="justify">First things first, research about your target market thoroughly. It is required that you know the nitty-gritty of the people who are going to use your website. A good way to do this is to have a conversation with the users. Let them use your product and gather their responses. A demo process before the actual process begins will give you a heads up in the market, and moreover, it notches you with the demand of the customer and not to forget the patterns of the customer and the market simultaneously.</p>
<p><b>Feedback will facilitate</b></p>
<p align="justify">Feedback should be followed up with action. After you have gained significant insights by analysing data received from users, it’s time for you to act upon it. The graphics aren’t catchy or the fact that the page takes a lot of time to load, content is not engaging- turn all the negative feedback into positive by taking prudent steps. By acting swiftly on the feedback, the chances of your success increases manifolds.</p>
<p><b>Size matters</b></p>
<p align="justify">Be very careful about the shape and size of what you put on your interface. More spacious the clickable icons, the easier it becomes for user-web interactions. The interaction type- scrolling vertically or scrolling horizontally should be carefully handled. It can make the user cranky if the interface is not friendly enough to browse and scroll appropriately and hence the placement of the scroll bars most effectively is imperative.</p>
<p><b>Tradition and Modernity</b></p>
<p align="justify">Innovation and Creativity are highly appreciated. But, don’t sway extremely too far from the traditional methods. A familiar interface with just the right amount of revamping actually improves the overall design. If a save functionality is added to a button with the icon of a ‘printer’, you are right; the interface is never going to fetch you enough customer base.</p>
<p><b>Keep it Simple </b></p>
<p align="justify">Simplicity should be your key all along. It is logical to state, simple things are easy to learn and easy to use. With minimal things for your users to learn and remember, their experience becomes efficient and effective altogether.</p>

      'overview' : 'Strolling through the paths of the tech capitals, ever heard the terms of UI design or UX design?',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">Strolling through the paths of the tech capitals, ever heard the terms of UI design or UX design? Here is a quick explanation of what they mean, to answer the queries in your head.</p>
<p>UI stands for User Interface whereas UX refers to User Experience. But, considering UI and UX same is a major technical faux pas.<br>
User Interface would involve a series of screens, icons and buttons that you use to interact with the website/device. User experience is the more technical and analytical field as it is used to gauge internal aspects of experience that a user has while interacting with your product or services.<br>
While the two of them are closely interlinked, the roles they are used for are entirely different. Working with them together becomes a crucial element for the product.<br>
The variation between them lies in the kind of the design discipline. Not only this, but the different parts of processes used can distinguish them from each other. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are two of the most commonly interchanged terms in the technical field. But, both are essential for the success of a product.<br>
In the words of professionals-User Experience is the process of development and improvement of quality interaction between a user and all facets of a company. User Interface refers to the aggregation of approaches and elements that allow the user to interact with a system.<br>
Proper knowledge of the UI and UX terminology is the way to facilitate a better approach taken and a better user experience after that.</p>
<p>It is more likely that the feedback a user forms in the head about the experience at website constitutes the UX. Even if the UI is beyond appreciation, if the functionality has lower standards, then the website is hardly in a position to produce a positive feedback.</p>
<p>In layman terms, you can understand UI as something that deals with what users look at. UX, on the other hand, deals with how and what users feel when interacting in virtual space.<br>
Under the gamut of UX is the flow of how a user proceeds on a website, maybe to subscribe or to sign up. Contrary to that, the UI handles the territory where the visual design for the same journey will be prepared to help the user to browse through the web site and navigate as and when required owing to his/her will.</p>
<p>The people or the designers who have hands-on industry experience in this field have different mindsets when working with UI or UX. Their line of thought, perceptions and execution strategies are different from each other yet linked in some or the other way. There is much more than what meets the eye whenever UI and UX are taken together into consideration. The UX ensures a user has an eventful and smooth browsing experience with an expanded knowledge of what the website is trying to convey whereas UI supports UX to cater to the navigation needs of the user.</p>
<p>Hence, the output of both processes is extremely varied. As they are distinguished fields, the skill-set required in both also differs considerably.</p>`,

By passing this measure means you risk wasting time optimizing and writing for things which are not entirely relevant to your crowd. You can spend all the effort and time in the world writing excellent content on your website, but they are never going to locate you if you do not use the language of your audience.</p>
<p align="justify">Keyword study is a means to learn more about your audience, how they think, and what they care about, so that you may align it with the content on your website. You ought to be capable of getting started doing keyword study on your site and approach the procedure as an easy method to create an alliance between the way you talk about your company and the way your clients talk about it. Since you can find such a wide variety of variables to consider determining which keywords to target for a page may be tricky.</p>
<p align="justify">The initial step is finding out what language your market is using to talk about your merchandise. Being in first place assists a great deal, but Click-through rate may also be useful as an index of how well you’re content fits up with the user’s question and that term. It is an indicator that individuals were not finding a better answer to their question farther upward on the page if your position is comparatively small, but CTR is still high. With a few tweaking, these queries might be a chance to improve exposure and rankings since you are replying the question better than sites in places ahead of you. You rank for, and another set that you want to work toward once you have an enormous list of essential phrases, the next thing is to break the keywords list down by subject. From the list you have compiled there are typically several different topics and subtopics that emerge.</p>
<p align="justify">Group Picks Several Key Terms to Goal and Key Words by Subject. To start, arrange these keywords by the topic after which select several head terms that you need to prioritize for each subject. The number of keywords you should depends on your resources, how important or big your website is, etc. Then pick a few head terms that are closely associated to target with each page. Select two or one high quantity, conditions that are competitive that you want to see improve and already rank well for. Join these head terms that are perfect with a few terms that are less competitive you may quickly optimize for.</p>

Not only can it be important to select the subjects that are right to hit, but it is also important to choose those issues to be covered by the right pages.</p>
<p align="justify">Stick to two or one strongly associated subjects per page. Keep in mind that may still mean you target multiple keywords per page that come under one theme. It is not much harder to optimize a page for one subject than for three. Contain both less competitive and competitive conditions in your strategy understanding that the more aggressive a term is, the more work you are going to have to do to earn a place on page one. Getting traffic that is combined with several conditions that are less competitive can add up to conversions as well as more and the same amount of traffic. The most valuable takeaway from keyword research that is successful should be a better comprehension of how your website does or does not meet your audience needs and what your audience needs are. Your aim should be to create content that is helpful and exciting to your market.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p><b>Target clientele and their behaviors </b></p>
<p>Now your information savvy clients in Bangalore are more dependent on online today over your preferred failing traditional mediums and methods. They gauge on many parameters to trust the builder to make a purchase decision. Isn’t it wise to reach your client through the devices which they carry all the time. Rather than selling your property through a traditional marketing approach, why don’t we try to make your client understand how important it is to buy our property which adds a number of values to his decision over both long and short time.</p>
<p><b>Cost Benefits</b></p>
<p>Traditional marketing like Newspaper and TVC’s price quotient is unrealistic today with their claimed but much doubted TRP ratings. More over the first page advert is allocated to you only when you buy a yearly package of ad space with the same medium. With online marketing your brands budget is spend accurately to your potential client to acquire or to make an impression to the brand awareness by targeting them based on their geography, age-group, interests and also the job profile. The fraction of cost you spent on the digital medium will <i>trigger your end client to act upon the call-to-action functions</i>. Bottom line is you will end up spending much more than acquire a client or his mindshare through traditional marketing methodologies instead of doing it online.</p>
<p><b>Digital Marketing for real estate is more of emotional branding</b></p>
<p>Digital marketing is not just glorify how amazing your property &amp; real estate is, but also to tell your potential client how we answer his aspirations and dreams that he is emotionally connected to. Since real estate is being a high ticket value product, we realize that the client takes a longer time to make a decision to buy. So your branding and communication will be part of the<i> journey to customer development process</i>. The process will be backed with consistent digital marketing and social media activities and will take some time to reap the benefits.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Being a marketer for past 3 years, I have closely served 150 brands in both, India and UAE. In the past whenever I came across the term "Growth Hacking",',
      'content' : `<p>Being a marketer for past 3 years, I have closely served 150 brands in both, India and UAE. In the past whenever I came across the term “Growth Hacking”, I have always felt that it was a western version of our Indian slang terminology- ‘Being Jugaad’ and my thoughts on it were that it was okay for a start-up company to find some out-of-the-box methods to grow faster across sales, operations, human resources or even customer satisfaction. It has worked for few in the past but for some, it may not work at all. As the director of <a href="assets/images/">www.brandstory.in</a> I now consult some of the largest brands who have dominated their respective verticals over decades and have introduced new stars (BCG Matrix) in their product portfolio, which needed some immediate attention. Many challenges come into the picture when the management wants to adapt growth hacking towards their stars. Let’s see how we can implement growth hacking in the corporate structure by overcoming certain challenges.</p>
<p><b>Attitude</b></p>
<p>Let’s be honest here. For some, growth is a wish, for others it’s a plan and very few plan and work hard(er) for the phenomenon called growth. We may have many perspectives outside but mostly it depends on the core expertise of the deliverer which can be coding, marketing, analytics or even execution.</p>
<p>It is easy for a startup to adapt growth hacking since there is no definite pressure to achieve a definite number through an activity. Usually, startup’s adapt growth hacking with the mindset of “Become Big or Die Hard”. So it’s easy to list out 20 odd ways to promote the business and get benefited from that one activity to gets things right.</p>
<p>So the question is do the corporate heavy-weights have a growth hacking mindset? Can they prepare a team to work hard in order to get results and then prepare that team to be willing to fail frequently?</p>
<p>Will a corporate accept to work hard with experimental activities and indefinite time frames based completely out of the usual “insights and stats” scope?</p>
<p>Because that’s what growth hacking is! If your corporate hierarchy, doesn’t let you fail quick and small, you are missing the most important component of growth hacking.</p>
<p><b>Agile</b></p>
<p>Within corporates, strategic planning and management are present in the system to assess the current internal and external factors, where you ideate and formulate a high-level strategy to get them executed flawlessly.</span></p>
<p>Then you reevaluate and refine the ongoing strategy. Growth Hacking works on Agile. Period.</p>
<p>Agile gives you the flexibility of frequent adaptation to dynamic business circumstances. People with different skill sets and their frequent interactions are crucial above the business processes. With very limited planning agile helps you to get start with the project.</p>
<p><b>Activity</b></p>
<p>So Attitude and Agile can be sorted by the few management and innovation enthusiasts in the corporate system but that doesn’t exactly prove that the existing rating systems will help to rate a growth hacking enthusiast/team in the company.</p>
<p>A corporate system appreciates an employee only through the quantity of results he can provide whereas most of the growth hacking activities may not bring in any immediate results to the key business objectives.</p>
<p>Because in reality, we can measure a growth hacker only by the number of activity (+ sub activities) done, with the frequency of the activity against the time period given to drive the growth metrics. That transforms to (Activities+Frequency) / Time Period.</p>
<p><b>Analyze</b></p>
<p>Measure every single growth hacking activity and its impact, so you can optimize quickly as and how every activity demands. Add or Remove tools to have the impact you desire. There is a list of tracking tools for product management, project management, acquisition, sales and retention. Have them in a loop to monitor, optimize, experiment and to analyze, so you can activate a better process with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Definitely growth hacking, isn’t a rocket science. Just these 4A’s should be fun experimenting! It certainly was fun adopting these and hacking all the way.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>You have stumbled upon a million-dollar idea but is it enough? Is your great idea good enough? There is no way to learn that for sure until you actually try them out but there are ways to prepare yourself by testing your idea in the market before actually establishing a business or a startup around it. Here are few problems you need to sort out before heading out into the market. </p>
<p><b>What are the pain points you are trying to adhere to and defining what unique value your products or services bring into the market.</b></p>
<p>The best of the startups have come into existence when the founders themselves faced some problem and tried the derive a solution for the same. These startups have incepted from the idea of creating opportunities for themselves by creating solutions to their pain points. Then you need to justify the value created by that solution.Who wants this right now? Who else is facing the same problems as you? What is the extent of their need for your offering? Will they use something that is just a shallow version, merely fulfilling the minimum viability of the offering made by a two-person startup from unknown parts of the hemisphere? If the answer to these questions are in positive go ahead, you have yourself something real and acceptable to offer.</p>
<p><b>Scope out your industry: Do an intensive market research</b></p>
<pThink you are interested in entrepreneurship? Have you made up your mind about your <i>preneur? </i>Now, it’s time to identify the perfect entry point into the market. Once you have addressed the value proposition of your offerings, you need to see the existing paradigm in the market and analyse who are providing similar if not exactly same products or services. It is good to have competitors because that validates the existence of a market for your products or services. There are tons of things that you can learn from the existing players in the market. How well they fair in the market? What mistakes they did while the initial phase of their establishment and how did they get back from their shortcomings? What do the customers appreciate about them? What is your point of difference with respect to your competitors? How can you improve upon your existing offerings and how much are people willing to pay for what you have to offer? Doing a competitive analysis gives you a better idea regarding the overall likelihood of a successful venture.</p>
<p><b>Choosing the target market</b></p>
<p>Analysis of the market gives you a good insight about the existing conditions of the market and you can identify the trends doing the rounds in the market at that point of time. The next step is to brainstorm the right target customer base you want to sell your product/service to. Appealing to everyone translates to nothing and actually appeals to no one. A general demographic isn’t enough, so you must direct your efforts to hone in your targeted buyer personas. Identify and brainstorm micro markets that you want your product or service to prevail in. It is pretty evident that businesses have to break through lots of noise and chatter to reach out to the right audience and capture their attention. Creating buyer persona profiles gives you a clearly organized target market and you can tailor your content right from words of messaging to your complete marketing campaign as per the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different persona groups. In other words, this allows you to understand and manage the specific needs and interests within the micro markets and identify the typical background of the <i>ideal </i>buyer for your product. After all you must know what makes your customers tick!</p>
<p><b>Branding your business: Name, Logo and Presence</b></p>
<p>Choosing the right name for your business is vital and you need to think long and hard before coming down to that final call. Make sure that it doesn’t confuse with any existing brand name in the market which can lead to loss of sales and also complicate into legal actions. Also check for the availability of web domain which is more or less in line with the company name because that is the first thing your target audience sees. Get a professional logo designed which is a crucial decision if you are serious about developing your business in future. A unique look creates an impression across prospective customers and gives them confidence regarding your offerings and marks as your Brand identity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Create a business plan</b></p>
<p>You would not build a house without a blueprint. Similarly, you should not start any venture without a well-designed business plan. A well planned business model serves many purposes. It not only acts as a means to introduce your business to banks or investors for loans and funding purposes but also provides a clear direction for the business. A business plan also counts in contingency plans in case of unexpected events. The business plans lists out all the pros and cons of doing a business and if the pros outweighs the cons, then your business plan is good to go. A professional and well-crafted business plan has a step-by-step work process right from the executive summary to the financial forecasting, which covers as the most essential aspect of securing investment.</p>
<p><b>Do you have access to all resources to launch your business?</b></p>
<p>You need not be a richie rich to start a business. It all depends on your idea. How substantial or unique is your idea? If not unique, then how exactly are you different from the other players in the market? There needs to be some kind of special element in your offering that drives people to favor you over your competitors. It may be anything: Your product in general, the customer experience you offer, sales support, pricing and offers or anything that the customer finds exclusively from you. And to translate this USP to the customers you need combination time, money and smartness. Marketing of a product or service starts right from the inception of the idea for the offering and you need to make sure that you have all the necessary ingredients to deliver what you promise. Unless and until you are absolutely sure about what you have to offer, wait out before entering the market. There are many aspects to look into like looking into all the legality related issues of licensing and other contractual agreements. Getting permit for sales and services, agreement with suppliers and distributors in case of products business. You should ensure that all the processes right from sales to supplier agreements are all legal binding and contracted up with relevant terms and conditions. Partnering up with businesses is also a choice to facilitate resources and it also helps in tapping into an existing customer base of loyalists. In all, it is about getting the best out of the least to deliver the best to the customers.</p>
<p><b>Strategizing a marketing plan for your brand</b></p>
<p>What is the point of having a business if nobody knows about it? If you plan on building over an idea right from ground-up, you are most likely to plan an effective marketing strategy that accompanies your offerings. If you don’t then all the value proposition and benefits are overshadowed by the lack of visibility and reach across your prospective customers. Both digital as well as traditional marketing is essential to reach out to the right set of audience for your products or services. Digital footprint is essential for all forms of business. If one can’t find you online, it’s as if you don’t really exist. Even if you don’t sell over online or e-commerce platform, it is still paramount to have an online presence via websites, social and other forums to create visibility of your products or services. You need not be a marketing whiz or start with a big marketing budget, all you need is to start small and focus on building relationships to get your name out there. The key to successful marketing is to understand the customer value of your business, reflect upon your brand image and capitalize over your point of difference across the market. It is all about building a reputation for yourself as well as your business in the market.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Claim your name : The 1st step is to claim a name for your business. More often than not, the names you choose for your business has already been copyrighted by existing big brands and savvy corporations.',
      'content' : `<ol><li ><b>Claim your name</b><br>
The 1st step is to claim a name for your business. More often than not, the names you choose for your business has already been copyrighted by existing big brands and savvy corporations. The lack of a relevant domain name for your business website may severely harm your digital credit and you need to be agile to grab the best before somebody snatches the URLs. This helps extensively to gain control of a brand or trademark. Whether you are claiming a particular username on Facebook or choosing a Twitter/Instagram handle or registering a domain name, it needs to be a progressively worked out plan to stake out your territory across your digital assets.</li>
<li ><b>Build your website</b><br>
You have your name, you have your domain, you have your business plan ready, now it’s time to build your website. You need a website to showcase your brand across the digital space. Your business website is like a piece of real estate which corresponds all accesses in the digital infrastructure of the business. Getting a unique URL is just the beginning, what follows is construction of a website that clearly projects the vision and mission of the company and is highly optimized at the same time. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the key to enhance the visibility of your website by increasing your Search engine ranking across search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. Unlike traditional SEO, modern SEO focuses on optimizing websites for the users rather than search engines. 5 key elements of optimizing a website are:
<ol>
<li >URL Structure<br>
The URL of a web page is the web address used by the users to access your web content over the internet. URL structure refers the assembly of text in the URL and how each URL associated with the website react among one another. Some relevant aspects to optimize URL structure are:
<ul>
<li >URL must contain the focus keyword</span></li>
<li >Separate individual keywords with dashes for the internal page URLs</li>
<li >Use 301 redirect errors in case of permanent redirect for site maintenance issues prolonging more than a day. Google prefers 301 error instead of giving credit to multiple versions of the same web content and URL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li >Page title<br>
Title of the page is what you see at the Tab of the browser window when you visit a webpage. SEO optimized page titles must adhere to the following guidelines:<br>
– Include focus keyword in the title<br>
– Title must be more than 35 characters but less than 65 characters.<br>
– Add company name at the end of the title<br>
– Add unique page title for each page within the website</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li >Meta Description</li>
<li>This contains a short summary of the content of a particular web-page and must contain the focus keyword of that web page. </li>
<li >Headings<br>
The heading must be relevant to the keyword across a particular webpage so it is suggested to use only one &lt;h1&gt; tag as the focus keyword of that page. In case of a text-heavy blog posts, it is advisable to add a few &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; tags as paragraph titles.</li>
<li >Images<br>
Images add as a catalyst to enhance user experience on a website. But excessive images can slow down the loading of a page, so one should add only relevant images and also associate keyword specific filename and add keyword specific alt tag for descriptions to enhance SEO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Getting an optimized website reflects well across the search engine and is accepted by the users as it inspires confidence in your brand. So, get a unique domain name for the URL and build a website around it and optimize it so that it stands tall on its own.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content development</b><br>
You have built an optimized website, the next step is to develop unique and creative content. 'Content is the king' is an overused cliche but stand true for an effective internet marketing strategy. Unless and until you engage your target audience, you cannot reach out to the customers (or potential customers), and developing strong and engaging content is the way to achieve popularity across digital space. Whether it be an infographic content or an informative blog associated to your website, a well written high quality can not only drive visitors to your website but cater to a specific targeted crowd who are most likely to be converted into leads. Blogging is a dynamic way of injecting strong content over the websites and also helps ranking higher in Search engine ratings. Blogging is focussed approach as a magazine or a journal writer rather than a marketing manager or a business owner. It has a customer centric approach from the point of view of a regular individual which is essential to connect with the right set of audience. Any content across a blog must serve the purpose of educating or entertaining the potential customers rather than pushing your products or services across them. Blog isn’t the only content effective to generate traffic and further leads. Other contents like e-books, research reports and whitepapers can also be used to generate leads for the business. There are other non-text contents too like how-to videos, presentations, webinars etc. that together help businesses to contact, interact, connect, reconnect, convince and finally convert into customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Social Presence</b><br>
It is not enough anymore to just have a website for your business across the digital space. Your digital storefront extends to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, though Linked is more of a professional network than a social like others. Social media presence has become eminent considering the huge scope of directly communicating with your target audience and learning about their interests which can serve to better deliver your products and services in your target market. Social media acts as an effective interface between the company, the employees and the customers is an ever evolving medium of self sustaining growth across the digital space. While there is a wide array of social networks across the digital space but the main focus is on the “big three”: Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. If you don’t own a Twitter account or a Facebook page for the company, it’s time to get on with the program and bring yourself up to speed. Having a LinkedIn company page is a major asset asset for marketing your company across business professional and find interested parties to gain keen insights and add value to your company’s digital credit. Social media is a key driver of your brand’s online presence and facilitates targeted content distribution. So, once you are done with your website integrate it with social media networks and start capitalizing on it for gaining competitive advantage across digital arena.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Get listed in directories</b><br>Apart from websites and social media platforms, it is important to register yourself in directory sites as well. Some common examples are Yahoo Local, Yelp, Just Dial but it is more likely that you must have a dedicated directory for your specific business. Start with listing yourself in the popular directories across broader categories. And then look out for specific ones and register your company and website there too. Make sure that you develop a complete profile and not just your basic contact info. Having a complete profile inspires confidence among the audience who are looking out for your products and services and creates a positive brand perception. Include all business details like Company name, logo, contact info with designated person and other relevant pieces of information as per the directory site requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Creating Buyer Persona Groups</b><b><br>
</b>Once you get your digital existence across website and social media platforms up and running, it comes down to converting your audience into leads. The increased traffic to your site derived from all the above activities isn’t generating any business. You see many new visitors coming to your site but these visits aren’t transforming into new customers. So, it is time to do some Inbound Marketing which is the best way to convert visitors into potential leads. You need to create a Buyer persona profile which enlists targeted individuals based on their specific interests. This allows you tailor your content right from words of messaging to your complete marketing campaign as per their specific needs, behaviors, and concerns across different persona groups. In other words, this allows you to understand and manage the specific needs and interests within the micro markets and identify the typical background of the </span><i>ideal </i>buyer for your product. You need to regularly update your credentials and add more and more information about what you have to offer to drive interest from your target audience. Then you need to identify each buyer persona group and direct your marketing campaign exclusively to meet their specific expectations. This hones up to higher rate of acceptance by the potential customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Creating a Call to Action</b><b><br>
</b>Adding a strong call to action is very important to get targeted insight of the customers or potential customers visiting your website. First, you need to identify what your online visitors want to do when they visit your website and then encourage them to do so through an effective Call to Action. Your call to action needs to convince the visitors to take some kind of action no matter how small it is. Adding CTAs for “Subscription to company’s newsletter” or “Connecting to a company phone number” and many other CTAs can help capture attention of the visitors in an incredibly brief window to avoid bounce from the website. While designing a Call To Action, you need to follow two main principles: Visibility and Clarity of the message. There are multiple elements that can be added both focussed on these two principles but you need to decide the best one and not overcrowd the CTA. When choosing the best alternative or collection of elements it is better to conduct an A/B testing to get a definitive prove for the best CTA. It may sound like a lot of extra effort, but the resulting improved action rates and overall website performance makes it worth the effort. Once you define the most appropriate call(s) to action for your business, add them throughout your site so people see them often and easily. If you’re committed enough to actually boost your rate of conversion across digital space, it is very important to write a compelling Call to Action. </li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Manage your online reputation</b><b><br>
</b>Monitoring your reputation over the digital space is also an essential part of sustaining the perfect space across the internet. It is not like Facebook that gives you just a Like button and no Dislike button. A single negative comment or review can defame your reputation and lead to subsequent loss of valuable audience. Your digital presence needs to be consistently monitored and scrutinized to showcase the best version of your business to your audience. Online reputation management includes the following activities:</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Monitor your reputation by keeping a track of the reviews and ratings. Your ratings and reviews directly impact your online reputation and you need to immediately act on them to suppress the negatives if any.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Managing the reviews is also an important task. Feedback is very necessary for optimizing your online presence and these feedbacks (positive ones) act as means to gain visibility and positive fame across the the digital space which encourages and builds trust among other members of your target audience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Handling a damage repair scenario is one of the most difficult aspects of ORM. Bad PR, negative comments etc needs to be reviewed from time to time and these individuals need to be addressed by providing them with the best possible solutions. It is like grievance handling where you counter act to prevent any damage to the company’s name.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Highlight positive reviews and ratings. Helpful reviews that highlight company’s brand value and ratings (4 and above) showcase the success of your business in providing adequate solution to your customers whether it be products or services. These reviews must be amplified across social media and other digital spaces.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Make a budget plan</b><br>
Budgeting is a very vital part of designing a complete business plan while capturing your online presence. Any digital marketing campaign requires a structured plan to act upon and is developed keeping in mind about the resources, spendings and availability of the access across the digital space. The ROI associated with digital marketing is easily quantifiable. One needs to count in all the essentials associated with the campaign and not just the primary factor i.e. Building a website. Building a website for the company is just the start of an overall digital marketing campaign, there are other expenses too that are associated with PPC Ad Campaigns, Content marketing campaign, SEO, Social media marketing and many more. All these are essential “drivers” to claim the best possible space across digital arena and should not be ignored while deciding on the budget expenditure for digital marketing. <br>
<br>
And if you want the best results, you need to invest accordingly. The key strategy as part of the primary objective may not include a budget for everything, but as you progress you need to spend more to get more.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Get your Analytics and Testing Strategy in Place</b><br>
With frequent updating algorithms of SEO and ever increasing platforms for Social media activity, there is a dire need to have a proper analytic structure in place to measure your activities across the digital space. One cannot directly jump into the the digital arena with contents without analyzing the efficacy of it. No matter how strong you may think your offering is, there are millions of individuals and companies who may be targeting the same space as you. You need to test your offering before you actually showcase it over any digital platform. It is a challenge to prioritize your target area where you want to penetrate to get your desired audience and you need to determine the best channels for you as quickly as possible based on the metrics that justify as per your marketing strategy.<br>
<br>
Analytics is very critical and complex and you cannot master it overnight. You need to carefully hone your skills as analyst by analysing all the quirks associated with &nbsp;specific channels using multiple tools to collect data and then set up the complete digital marketing infrastructure for a successful digital campaign.</li>

      'overview' : 'With the market share of almost 2 percent and 7 percent population penetration, e-commerce industry is the future of sales and service.',
      'content' : `<p>With the market share of almost 2 percent and 7 percent population penetration, e-commerce industry is the future of sales and service. Every successful industry is keen on exploring the immense opportunity and increase their digital presence to capture the maximum share of the market. The success stories of Indian e-commerce is known to every individual, but often people forget to notice the failure of the industry.</p>
<p>Success is an outcome of careful planning and strategic execution of the business model. With a mad race in the e-commerce businesses that are looking forward to explore the opportunity and mark their presence on the online platform should incorporate a very comprehensive list of activates to assure success. The prime area of attention for an e-commerce industry are:</p>
<ol>
<li>E-Commerce is the new traditional marketing</li>
<li>Understanding the need of time</li>
<li>The right business model</li>
<li>Delivering values not just product or service</li>
<li>Targeting the appropriate customer segment</li>
<li>Easy process</li>
<li>Customer is always right</li>
<li>Maintaining &nbsp;your reputation</li>
<li>Evolve with the needs of time and customer</li>
</ol>
<p><b>E-commerce is the new traditional marketing:</b></p>
<p>In the age of millennials, everyone is in a hurry, hurry to reach the height in the least span of time. E-Commerce is the solution to all their needs, saving their precious time. In this era people are getting more comfortable when a product or service is delivered at their doorstep at their suitable time than spending hours browsing on the street or store bearing the heat of traffic while commuting.</p>
<p>E-Commerce industry need to the adapt to their customer and instead of treating itself as an exclusive solution, it needs to accept the reality of time and invest its resources even more than traditional marketer to educate the people about the advantages and explain them their own needs of time. E-Commerce industry is now not just a hobby but a very competitive industry.</p>
<p><b>Understanding the need of time</b>:</p>
<p>Before even starting the business, every company needs to introspect about the product or service they are planning to deliver. Ask yourself the difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do customers need this?</li>
<li>Are there better solutions already available in the market?</li>
<li>What values are we giving to the customer?</li>
<li>Are we entering late or early to the market?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a very tough decisions and all these parameters needs to be carefully understood and examined to assure that the idea is viable and growth is evident. The success can only be evaluated over the period of time, but if it delivers values and needs to the customers, success will follow.</p>
<p><b>The right business model:</b></p>
<p>You might have the next big idea, but a careless, unplanned and unexplored outcome in a business model can be the sole cause of your business failure. The idea needs to be tested over and over again. The structure should be well laid and the revenue should be carefully studied, after all it’s all about the profits one makes from the business. Generating revenue is not only the need for self but also for the business, a business in loss cannot function forever.</p>
<p><b>Delivering values not just product or service</b></p>
<p>Building an emotional connect with the audience and customer is very important. The logo, tagline, mission and vision of the business should be designed keeping in view the customer and employees of the company. When purchasing from you company the customer should feel associated with the company and a strong feeling of belief should lead the transaction. One of the important key factor affecting this is the employees of the company, a highly motivated employee force spread the message “the company cares for you”.</p>
<p>Customer not only buy your product or service but engage to build a strong long term connection. Get emotionally connected and make their every purchase a life changing experience for them.</p>
<p>Remember there are who are ready to offer them what you have, create a point of differentiation for a better customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><b>Targeting the appropriate customer segment:</b></p>
<p>Every product or service does not interest everyone, every individual has different needs. Every e-commerce industry needs to carefully evaluate their target segment. Every segment of the society is present online, you product or service might not be the need of all. The company resource should not be invested on the segment that are not potential target or even a close lead for the business. Every advertisement should capture specific audience and deliver the message bold and strong.</p>
<p>Careful and creative advertisement placement and highly targeted approach should be followed to gain the maximum of the available resource. Hitting blind targets might be successful a few time but not in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Easy Process</b></p>
<p>Always remember you are there for the customer satisfaction and happiness, you are not an interrogator. Keep the information flow simple and highly precise, customer need only what they want or what they are offered. The overall process that is right from the visit to final checkout should be systematic and easy to understand. One must not ask for irrelevant or highly personalised information. The traction process epically should be very quick and easy to use.</p>
<p><b>Customer is always right</b></p>
<p>In a customer driven industry, there is only one mantra “customer is always right”. Every customer complaint or suggestion should be of high priority. Every mistake that the company incur only adds to the vicious cycle of bad reputation.</p>
<p>At the end of the day customer satisfaction should be the priority of the company, even if in the process the company incurs a few loss but at the same time it should ensure that the goodwill of the company should not be taken for granted and exploited.</p>
<p>Do plan occasional surprise for your loyal customers and reach to the people who seek advice.</p>
<p><b>Maintaining your reputation</b></p>
<p>The trust in a company only prevails if the customer get regular positive response and feedback. The company should regularly engage on social media platform to understand what their customer feel about the services and products offered. While engaging on the social media the responses should be personified rather than leaving an impression that a corporate is interacting with the audience. Keep it as human as possible.</p>
<p>Customers’ queries should be adequately answered and a little humour with wittiness is always welcomed by the customer. The achievements of the company should be marketed with uttermost preciseness, and should look as the achievements of the customer rather than company boosting about itself also popular customer responses and companies special activities should be promoted on the social media.</p>
<p><b>Evolve with the needs of time and customer</b></p>
<p>The needs of the customers are endless, even they don’t know what they need unless they are offered. As a business one should keep evolving and testing new products and services that change the life of the customer or make their life easy. Also it is very important to address the immediate need of the customers and ensure the activities or process that are highly rejected by the customers are simplified as per customer needs.</p>
<p>Keep experimenting and keep adapting to the changing needs of the customer to be the next big success. <br>

      'content' : `<p><strong>Be a Publisher but not an Marketer.</strong></p>
<p>Engage. Engage. Engage. Do not try to endorse your product or services in your digital marketing content. Always write things that will engage your end clientele. Rather than addressing benefits of your products and services, tell them what is their pain points which have to be addressed and how you have solutions for same. Forget your sales target while you writing a blog / article. Tell them that how you are here&nbsp;to help them but do not chase them to sell. Add value so they can believe that you are the best one to trust. So your social media content is consumable rather than in edible.</p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong></p>
<p>Let the blogs or articles be a replica of yourself. Make sure&nbsp;that your clients get the tone, personality of your brand, culture, belief through your writing. Even if you get your writings through an external agency like us, ensure that the substance is replica of your own soul. Never give an image to your client of something you are not. So your online reputation will be the true mirror of your practices. Write your own content from your experiences. Authenticate the usability of the product and services through your own experiences. Write things and publish in your social media channel such as why you are in the business and what drives you to be excellent in providing solution in your chosen field. Let them know the passion for your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Give your best.</strong></p>
<p>Everybody knows content plays an important role in nurturing a brand’s credibility online. This credibility is built over consistent postings of blogs and articles through your social media agency or the digital marketing companies you hire. To keep up consistency many brands write articles which are not at their&nbsp;best. If you believe in the concept something is better than nothing,<em>oops!</em>Not really. You are risking the credibility of your clients and followers by posting not quality work. Give them something which is valuable, which they can take them free to continue following and admiring you.</p>

      'content' : `<p>Its not surprising to look at young CEOs and VPs, who have had barely a few years of experience with large corporations, deciding to start their own companies.</p>
<p>Few years back, starting a company of your own might have sounded ambitious for many, and impossible for the youngsters who came out of a middle class background.</p>
<p>Gone are those days! The corporate culture is now changing and it can be seen in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. It is undeniable that the startup ecosystem in Bengaluru has attracted enterprising, and progressive minds from every nook, and corner of the country.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces in Bangalore offer a comfortable nest for migrating entrepreneurs and add them to the warmth of Bangalore’s startup community.</p>
<p>Before an entrepreneur decides to pursue his journey in entrepreneurship, all he needs is a friend’s place to stay and use as his office address.</p>
<p>A young entrepreneur, Mr. Vivek, moved into Bangalore&nbsp;with an obsession on UI very recently. He works out of BHiVE Workspace at Koramangala and he says that, “Working out of a coworking space is great advantage for a new entrepreneur. I find an investment banker, a coding marvel, an exceptional operation guy and a digital marketing girl, all in one single table!”.</p>
<p>He also mentions that, “to recruit and build a team of this stature will take too much of time and an enormous monetary investment. Now, we discuss and get to know in detail about each other’s expertise. The learning in such a place is huge and all of this happens only due to amazing coworking culture in Bangalore”.</p>
<p>With multiple coworking options in Bangalore, very few add value for money with outstanding facilities offered like plug and play spaces, meeting rooms, training rooms and exclusive office room on daily, monthly and yearly packages.</p>
<p>Another entrepreneur, Mr.Kumar, a veteran startup investor states that, “the success of startup lies in how fast they can grow in their first year. To accomplish a faster growth, the team needs to focus on bringing in more business to the company rather than worrying about the internet, the housekeeping, commercial space, etc. With Bangalore&nbsp;providing various option of coworking spaces, it is very easy to nurture the dream of building a business faster. And with a coworking space like BHiVE, which gives me access to their multiple locations, it helps entrepreneurs to move and work with in the city at their comfort”.</p>
<p>With excellent services and community perks, the leading coworking spaces in Bangalore&nbsp;is given an edge to the success for the entrepreneurs and allows them to make their dream a reality.</p>
<p>With startup events and meetups, BHiVE Workspace welcome entrepreneurs to network, collaborate and create. Very few coworking spaces, like BHiVE, are capable of bridging the gap between VCs and angel funding to startups that work based in their own coworking spaces.</p>
<p>Bangalore&nbsp;being the coworking destination of India, spaces like BHiVE add value and help shape vision of thousands of entrepreneurs in the city.</p>

          'content' : `<p>There are lots of challenges and malfunctions organizations can run into when determining to rebrand. But what are a number of the areas that are more common to be alert to? Here's what you need to know:-</p>
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Missing research</h2>
          <p>The world is going at a fast speed, and the perspectives and perceptions your customers held last year might not be useful this year. Marking down research that is solid at the beginning of your rebranding journey means you will make conclusions without having penetrations to hand and all the directing tactical information.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not employing the right key stakeholders</h2>
          <p>It's crucial to have the right stakeholders if they are to buy into the brand journey. Supplying Sales or the Board a chance to give will ensure a simpler path to the internal adoption of the brand. On the flipside, there is a fine line between becoming overwhelmed with feedback from all the areas of one's company and engaging your key stakeholders.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Enabling personal choices to get in the way</h2>
          <p>We're all passionate about our own brands, however, it's important to stay objective when transferring throughout the rebranding process. Stay objective about taglines and possible proposals and don't bring personal tastes when developing the visual identity.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Thinking as a campaign of your brand</h2>
          <p>Taking on a campaign-only state of mind might lead to dynamic, catchy taglines yet it doesn't empower the building of brand equity that will survive beyond the latest marketing tendencies. When going throughout the rebranding procedure, it's important to remember that this is over just a launch campaign. Your brand is the directing force behind every bit of promotion you do.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Breaking your own rules </h2>
          <p>Breaking brand guidelines as soon as you have them immediately fractures the visual basis you're building. How may you anticipate your internal teams and external providers to follow the guidelines if you don't? It's important to keep visual expression consistent for maximum impact in your marketplace.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Underestimating the internal transformation attempt</h2>
          <p>It may be tempting to simply roll out your brand across the old parts, but what needs to be updated and what needs to be retired? What new assets do you want that you don't presently have? And it's not only advertising assets: your brand covers sponsorships, company records, presentations, IT, recruiting and internal use. The risk is in underestimating this attempt. Setting together a stakeholder group that is working should ensure your rebrand covers the demands of your organization.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not briefing external providers completely</h2>
          <p>External providers can bring your brand to life via security that is owed; whether it includes video or signage content. Creating a comprehensive briefing session between your service and any design nuances will be prevented by your external providers from becoming lost in the transformation.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not taking stock</h2>
          <p>Neglecting to monitor the reaction and the influence your brand is having continuingly will mean you miss a chance to refine and improve incrementally. This step-by-step progress will save you from having to undertake a costly overhaul farther down the path, and you will be kept by the continuing assessment of your brand on top of what the market expects out of your brand.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not spending some time to nurture and to care</h2>
          <p>Your brand needs continuous care and consideration. Continue to embed the brand worth in your team, look for means to grow, improve your brand reach, and continue to work with providers which are invested in your brand's success.

          'content' : `<p>By creating an identity that becomes linked with specific understandings and feelings at its core, a brand is about affecting others. But branding is not only for businesses  any more. There's a growing tendency called Personal Branding that we believed could be intriguing to investigate. Successful Personal Branding entails handling understandings efficiently, and controlling and affecting how others think and perceive of you. Having a powerful Private Brand in the current on-line individual and virtual age is significant.</p>

          <p>Where to start? Well, you can determine the features that mark you as distinguishing from co-workers and rivals. What have you done lately to make you stick out? What would your opponents or co-workers record as your clearest and finest strength? What's your clearest private characteristic? Work on what you do that's identifying, quantifiable, distinguishable and of remarkable value. Work out what you are most proud of attaining. To truly become a brand, you will need to focus on these places that add value, that you may take credit for, and that you are proud of. You might be a brand; you have got a brand; it is now about placing you against your market.</p>

          <h2>Placing Yourself as a Brand</h2>

          <p>What's promising about this strategy is that it gives the chance to stick out, learn, improve and develop their abilities to everyone. Everybody can be a brand worthy of significant attention. There are various strategies to the notion of Personal Branding. A number of people define personal placing by concentrating on picture building, selling, packaging, external appearance, self-promotion, branding from a marketing standpoint, and becoming well-known. This could become an ego trip, and you might be perceived as egocentric and self-centered. This strategy will only take you thus far: Personal Branding advertising and is way more than promoting yourself.</p>

          <h2>Credibility </h2>
          <p>A more real strategy pressures you into making your Private Brand authentically and genuine Personal Branding is a journey towards a more successful and happier life. Therefore, your Private Brand needs to be bona fide. It should emerge out of your search for identification and meaning in life, and it is about developing yourself constantly, holding it in your mind, giving it all of your positive energy, and making quite clear what you need. Your Private Brand needs to be based on your values, strengths, singularity and brilliance and should represent your true nature. If you really can brand yourself in this natural manner, in that case, your brand will be precious to others, clear, and convincing. You will bring opportunities and the people that suit you. </p>

          <h2>Focus </h2>
          <p>Whatever happens, you need to quantify brand against four things today. You have to be a supportive co-worker and an excellent team player. You have got to be an extraordinary pro at something which has real value. Thirdly you'll need to be a comprehensive visionary - a leader, tutor, and an imaginer. Finally, you'll need to be closely focused on the consequences that are practical.</p>`,

          'content' : `<p>In advertising, it appears like the word brand is employed a great deal: the top brand, private brand, off-brand. But there is frequently confusion around its significance in operation. What does it entail? Do I need to employ a professional? Branding is pricey, right? To that last stage, it does not have to be. As it happens, several pretty creative ways do not require tons of cash to brand your company. And while it can necessitate an investment of time, the return on investment won't be noticed in some situations, and it can really help you save cash. Here is what you can do to brand your company:</p>

          <h2>Understand your personas</h2>
          <p>The behaviour of your prospective customers, aims, and the needs order how you share your products or services. Comprehending those things helps you discover what type of media your personas are using up, what inspires them, and where it resides. It's possible for you to see why having that info helps develop a robust, powerful brand that can help you reach the right folks.</p>

          <h2>Develop an identification and a voice</h2>
          <p>Your brand can start to take shape once you have identified your buyer personas. That calls for creating a brand identity, the things which make folks conscious of what the brand is, and his voice, which will be the tone you use within public communication or any copy.</p>

          <p>Finding that out follows a procedure, not unlike the one that is used to discover your personas. But instead of answering inquiries about your market, you are answering questions which can be a little more introspective to your brand. What's its worth? What does it signify? How do you need folks to talk about you?</p>

          <h2>Have a constant social network existence</h2>
          <p>It is important to determine where they are spending the most time, particularly on social media, since you might have a transparent image of the distinct bits of your audience. Pay close focus to the data. Perhaps the bulk of your characters spend most of their time on one network.</p>

          <p>It does give you a concept of where to devote the most resources while that does not mean you should disregard the others. And when you establish that existence, keep it. How often have you gone to the Facebook Page of a brand only to find that nothing has been posted in the past three months? Odds are, it did not have a favourable impact on your perception. Like you would with some other promotion calendar that can be prevented by diligently planning and scheduling social network posts. That plays an enormous part by sharing content that pertains to what they are probably thinking about at the confirmed time of year so that you remain important to your crowd.</p>

For anybody seeking professional growth, mentors might be among the very useful resources you can make use of to provide a new outlook, and generally for guidance, advice, support, and tactical responses to an issue.</p>

          <p>At their finest, without losing focus or trust, mentors will help you unlock your full potential and garner normally inaccessible knowledge about your business or peculiarity. Picking a mentor that is erroneous may result in an unproductive, frustrating relationship that takes you no closer to reaching your job goals.</p>

          <p>Nobody is perfect, and to get a mentor, your important initial step is self-awareness. Be sincere with yourself, and establish the place in your professional life you need to improve. Your mentor needs to be somebody who not only inspires you to do the same but in addition, excels in these places.</p>

          <p>Be clear about what you would like and do not sugarcoat it. You must be upfront about your anticipations before you embark on a mentor/mentee relationship. </p>

          <p>What're your targets, and why do you think this person can help you reach them? Truthfulness is essential, particularly at this early period.

          <p>No matter your position, look for a person who is able to walk in your shoes and comprehend or empathize with the unique challenges you face. Look for a person who shares your troubles and your passion.

          <p>From a mentor's perspective, you're one that will not always pay off, and you are an investment. If you want the partnership to thrive, you need to earn it. This implies doing your very best to trust that person when their guidance contradicts your own judgment, and suppressing your egotism when your mentor provides criticisms you'd rather not hear. In addition, you need to take care of your mentor's focus as a resource that is useful, so be sure to have a plan for each assembly.</p>

          'overview' : 'In this blog, we will talk about communication errors that occur frequently and how you could avoid them.',
          'content' : `<p>In this blog, we will talk about communication errors that occur frequently and how you could avoid them. Here are a few tips that you can keep in handy to avoid these mistakes: Written communication routes don't empower you to dampen hard messages with nonverbal cues (like body language), plus they don't empower you to deal promptly with extreme emotions.</p>

          <p>Do that in person in the event that you want to supply bad news. Do it in a manner which is sensitive, in order that you can share your message and think carefully but minimize long term upsetting at the same time. </p>

          <p>At any time you deliver an arduous message personally, you can pick up on signals that people can have chosen the information particularly badly, or might have misunderstood essential parts of your message. After that, you can take action to clarify your message, or help individuals deal with the hard news. </p></p>

          <p>Errors with tone, spelling, and grammar make you look careless. That is the reason why it is important before you send them to assess all of your communications.</p>

          <p>Do not rely on spellcheckers: words which are used wrongly won't be picked up by them. Instead, proofread your work, and make use of a dictionary to look up any words that you're uncertain about. </p>

          <p>You may discover that it's useful to make a set of phrases and words that you find it almost impossible to get right. </p>

          <p>It can be difficult to see errors in your very own work, so consider requesting a colleague to look over crucial files. Also, read your work aloud, which makes it easier to catch tone mistakes and typos. Then, give yourself time to make any final changes, as well as to reflect on your file. </p>

          <p>At some point, you are going to have to give negative feedback. It is tempting to test to prevent these dialogs, yet this may cause additional difficulties – especially that you may let little problems grow into large ones. Preparation is the main element in managing difficult conversations. You may additionally want to roleplay with your dialog first so that you feel confident in both your body language as well as your words. </p>

          <p>Have you ever yelled at a co-worker in discouragement, or sent a terse response to an email, without presuming your purpose through? If so, you're prone to have responded emotionally, rather than answering smoothly. This type of mental response can harm your standing. Folks may get disturbed with your powerful emotions, and you may give the feeling that you lack self-control and emotional intelligence. </p>

          <p>Assertiveness is about saying what you want while contemplating the needs and wants of others.
          You may not necessarily get your way if you're confident, but you stand to have an increased possibility of compromising since you've been clear about your requirements. Assertiveness also means saying "no" whenever you need to. </p>

          <p>In the event you use a "one-size-fits-all" approach to communication, you would possibly overlook people's distinct styles, needs and anticipation. The truth is, your communications need to address those differences as much as possible.</p>

          <p>If you're preparing a presentation, make certain you understand that you cater for these and that people have different learning styles. This suggests that everybody – from people that learn best by reading to those who would rather have a more hands-on strategy – can reap the benefits of your session. </p>

          <p>Bad reports, underprepared presentations, or badly written emails damage your standing and can frustrate your audience with time. This is the reason it is necessary to get ready and plan your communications carefully. </p>

          <p>First, set time aside to plan your communication extensively. Leave time to proofread, to check that files are compatible with your audience's applications, as well as to locate pictures. Subsequently, if you're giving a presentation or a speech, rehearse completely, so that you're inspirational and eloquent. </p>

          <p>Set time aside to listen whenever you meet with someone new. Give them space to talk about their views, and take time to soak these views up. After that, learn to handle cultural differences, to ensure you take each individual's demands and anticipation into account. </p>

          <p>Have you ever submitted a delicate email to the wrong man, or sent an incorrect attachment? Such mistakes may cause serious commercial issues, break privacy, and lead people to confusion and humiliation. To prevent these issues, before you choose the receiver, write the message, and after that, double-check their email address.</p>

          <p>In case email addresses are automatically filled in by your email program, you might need to turn this feature off, to ensure that you need to select the right receiver actively. You could find it useful to draft these emails in a blank email or a word processing document, after which you can paste the text right into a brand new message. In this manner, you will not inadvertently include any info from preceding messages. And, in the event that you are sending a confidential or sensitive attachment, check that no tracked changes and comments might be discovered, and make certain that you are sending the variant that is right. </p>

          <p> Always take time to assess that people have understood your message. As an example, whenever you send an email out, you can motivate individuals to answer when they have not comprehended parts of your message, or to react with questions. Or, in the event, you have given a demonstration, assemble in time for visitors to leave time for questions in conclusion, or to talk about your principal purposes. </p>

          <p>Communication errors are made by everyone every once in a while. Nevertheless, you'll safeguard your standing in the event you prevent the most frequently made errors, which could include not editing your work, being unassertive, and inadvertently breaking people's privacy when forwarding emails. The important thing to great communication is to think about your audience demands. Prepare each email, file, display cautiousness, and give yourself time to really check it. Most importantly, don't forget that communication is a two-way process. Be prepared for inquiries and listen to what your crowd has to mention. With time, you'll realize your job satisfaction, as well as that excellent communication can significantly improve your working relationships.</p>

Then it is important to listen in the event that you would like the esteem and admiration of the people who you lead. Say what you got to convey, and ask for comments from the workers on your team. Take notes, so they know you are listening as they talk when you're unsure of what point they are striving to make, and ask for clarification. Don't forget, occasionally talking in the manner of a leader means not talking at all, but letting others talk instead! </p>

          'content' : `<p>Most online browsers are natural-born skimmers. They want the gist before they decide to read any further. Wandering eyes have an inclination to gravitate towards headlines first, so it's wise to put some effort into crafting attention-gaining headlines and subheadings on your    webpages. Write powerful headlines following these guidelines to convince visitors to take a look at the rest of your website.</p>

          <h2>1. Be Illustrative and Direct</h2>
          <p>Since attention spans are not very long, you only have a few seconds to create interest with a headline or subhead. A headline that is highly effective should be illustrative of the content that follows. Determine on the principal purpose and place that into a brief string of words that are clear, concise. For a retail web site, this typically contains statements of current or forthcoming sales, new promotions, or seasonal offerings. For a website that is professional, this is usually a special characteristic or quality that establishes accountant, lawyer, or that special doctor besides others in the same area.</p>

          <h2>2. Keep It Brief</h2>
          <p>Google only presents 55-60 characters of a page's name. Anything beyond that isn't going to be seen by browsers. Headlines that are drawn-out are likely to be blown off anyhow, so think sweet and short when fixing or crafting a headline. It's usually best to avoid expanding a subhead to another line, just because it seems better to the eye.</p>

          <h2>3. Create Intrigue</h2>
          <p>By creating a level of mystery or intrigue with your headline solicit visitors and follow it up with, quality content that is connected to back it up. Only remember there is a fine line between intrigue and being obscure. Stirring up interest with a headline can be as easy as declaring a brand new service or merchandise, teasing an idea, or posting a question.</p>

          <h2>4. Adopt What's Proven to be Successful</h2>
          <p>Choose a clue from what tends to work nicely when selecting your headlines. The list concept may also be applied to your headlines and subheads whenever you want to present essential facts in a way that's not difficult to digest. If you need inspiration or you want to see headlines that work to get a notion of how to construct your very own, run a search on the issues or points unique to your content and see what turns up on the results pages. Check your analytics to see what posts are being shared the most on several social sites.</p>

          <p>As with various other components of your content, tracking and experimenting with results is the only method to know if your headlines and subheads are reaching results. Also use analytics to see how your conversion and bounce rates are affected by wording variations within your headlines and subheads.</p>

          <p>There's no denying that wonderful headlines need to be coupled with content that is equally appealing. Improve your return on investment and contact Content Writers now for immediate access to the help you need to transform your content.</p>

          'content' : `<p>Quality is just as significant with regards to the leads that your online content creates, and the activities taken by visitors who come to your website. There are specific measures you may take to foster conversions to take the desired actions.</p>

          <h2>1. Understand Your Crowd</h2>
          <p>Analyze the demographics of your visitors to understand how they are, and to whom you are really presenting content to gain from what you have to offer. The more unique your content is, the better the odds of bringing qualified leads. If you are targeting one or more crowds, create versions of your content for each audience you want to reach and distribute it suitably — i.e., emails, social network platforms, etc.</p>

          <h2>2. Have an Asking Website</h2>
          <p>You won't have a lot of success with your attempts to bring leads if you don't have an internet site that supports conversions. Pay attention to things such as page- navigation features, load times, and your call-to-actions.</p>

          <h2>3. Develop Real Social Relationships</h2>
          <p>Drive the dialogue on your social network accounts by soliciting views, introducing questions, reacting to remarks, and following up on issues that interest most of your followers or subscribers. More private involvement and all this is likely to increase visits to conversions as well as your website. Further your participation attempts and start or join groups on Facebook and LinkedIn to connect with others within your business. For even more impact, seek social influencers out and become a follower to tap in their network.</p>

          <h2>4. Form Mutually Beneficial Partnerships</h2>
          <p>By sharing resources, and working with a partner to mutually encourage each other's products or services, you'll also get access to a bigger pool of possible leads and conversions. Reach out to other companies offering similar products or complementary services. As an example, collaborating on a local job could mean lots of free marketing and added exposure for the brand.</p>

          <h2>5. Network and Host Webinars</h2>
          <p>Networking with professionals in your business presents a chance to make links which may lead to more prospects. On a connected note, good-orchestrated webinars may additionally showcase your brand in a tremendously private manner. Your crowd will probably consist of those who already have some interest in what you offer. Use the contact information you collect while signing up web seminar participants to send out follow up emails and support further interactions.</p>

          <p>Finding the right set of eyes to see your content is just as significant, although fresh, related content is an excellent place to start. Eventually, there is no secret formula for creating quality leads prone to become conversions. It's a goal that may be realized through a mix of approaches and strategies that'll be applied to objective leads wherever they are in the sales funnel. It's going to take some effort to remain as engaged with your crowd as possible while also seeking out new methods to boost your brand and expand your reach into new marketplaces, or subgroups within your present crowd.</p>

          'overview' : 'Staying socially engaged with your customers is an excellent thing. However, none of those attempts will matter much if visitors arent remaining long enough to take the desired actions',
          'content' : `<p>Staying socially engaged with your customers is an excellent thing. However, none of those attempts will matter much if visitors arent remaining long enough to take the desired actions – or any activity other than bouncing off. Here are several reasons why this can be occurring:</p>

          <h2>1. It's Not Mobile-Friendly</h2>
          <p>More than 90 percent of retail shoppers use a graphics tablet or a smartphone search for a desired service or merchandise or to purchase something. Put money into another website that is mobile, or upgrade your web site with measurements fixed for smaller displays. Use minimal bells and whistles to reduce page load issues that are possible, and supply additional space around the icon or clickable buttons.</p>

          <h2>2. Slow Page Load</h2>
          <p>Visitors tend to go elsewhere for what they're seeking if it takes longer than five seconds for a page to load. Load times might be slowed down by widgets, content improvements, images, ineffective or out of date code, or an internet site host with a slow server.</p>

          <h2>3. Content Doesn't Supply Clarity</h2>
          <p>If a visitor to your website has no clear idea of what you're offering, or what distinguishes the competition and your products or services, they're likely to bail rather quickly. Use descriptive headlines, multiple sub-heads, and brief paragraphs to achieve extreme clarity.</p>

          <h2>4. Text Is Hard to Read</h2>
          <p>Illegible fonts, random coloured or underlined packed paragraphs, and sentences or words in a small text size make the text on your web site hard to read and even irritating. Avoid joining text and background colours that make it impossible to read anything, and ensure that the text set over background pictures is not illegible.</p>

          <h2>5. Excessive Popups</h2>
          <p>Popup types which repeatedly or immediately ask visitors to join your newsletter, or other types which constantly popup might be incredibly annoying to return visitors. Furthermore, the use of autoplay videos tends to redirect focus away from more significant content.</p>

          <h2>6. Disproportionate Visuals</h2>
          <p>Visuals and pictures only improve web site content if they are not overly distracting. Size pictures or any videos you use on your web site suitably so that visitors are not overwhelmed once they arrive. Instead, you want to locate a great combination of written and video content to foster the attractiveness of your webpages.</p>

          <h2>7. A Lot Of Advertising</h2>
          <p>There's no need to fill every available area of space on your website. This can cause your main message to be obscured by excessive ads. Distribute your ads through your content so visitors can concentrate on your text and leave some empty space.</p>

          <h2>8. Delusory SEO Strategies</h2>
          <p>Misleading keywords and phrases or pictures might create clicks, but visitors are not going to stick around if the content presented is not related to what brought them there in the first place.</p>

          <p>Make sure to put in place or set up a Google Analytics account, if you have not done so already. The accessible data will tell which activities your visitors perform most often, where your web traffic is coming from, and how long people are remaining on each page of your website.</p>

          'content' : `<p>Your web site content creates a powerful impression on visitors. It should be simple to digest, and so it is important to strive for a product that’s clean, clear, useful, formatted right, and free from malfunctions. Regardless if you’re starting a brand new website, refreshing an existing one, or simply need to keep great effects, here are a few rules to remember as you prepare your web site content.</p>

          <h2>1. Research Your Keywords</h2>
          <p>Even when you’re choosing to have an organic search results page as opposed to running campaigns that are paid, keyword study is significant to traffic that is targeted. If a keyword is very popular, contemplate using relevant keywords that your opponents are using less, or its variants.</p>

          <h2>2. Hyperlink to Sources</h2>
          <p>Add power to your content by linking back to sources of any stats you reference. Mentioning references adds credibility to your website.</p>

          <h2>3. Tell a Powerful Narrative</h2>
          <p>Move away from the Wikipedia variation of how your firm was founded and discuss perspectives which make your brand unique, values, and those qualities. Improve your narrative and additionally create interest in your storyline with a useful video clip or with associated pictures. Since page load times can slow, do show some restraint with your use of visual content.</p>

          <h2>4. Prevent the Passive Voice</h2>
          <p>Talk as if the activity is going on now as opposed to slipping into a passive voice. Use action verbs. Stick through your copy with the same tense; and present your text within an active tense as much as possible. This will create content that’s simple to follow and to participate. Also prevent the excessive use of adjectives.</p>

          <h2>5. Keep Brief and Paragraphs Pleasant</h2>
          <p>Keep click-happy visitors engaged as opposed to long, comprehensive paragraphs with short blocks of content. Get out from the custom before proceeding onto the next paragraph of finishing an idea or subject. Break up issues or subjects with subheads. Bulleted lists make your content more digestible and bring the eye into your content by creating a visually appealing flow</p>

          <h2>6. Check and Update Your Links</h2>
          <p>Whether hyperlinks are external or internal, they won’t be of any use to visitors if they are no longer active. Keep in mind, Google scans the quality of your links. You might find it helpful to establish a Google Calendar alarm including ones in older content, at least monthly, as a reminder to check your links.</p>

          <h2>7. Use Attention-Grabbing, Important Headlines</h2>
          <p>Most online visitors are in the habit of skimming a website, which often ends— and usually begins — with looking at the headlines. Improve your content with attention-grabbing headlines which are to the point.</p>

          <h2>8. Don’t Get Too Practical</h2>
          <p>Unless of course, your website is home to technical issues, create content that’s not difficult to comprehend. In case there are things which need to be described in great detail, supply a link to a source that is reliable, and stick to the basics with your web site content.</p>

          <h2>9. Freshen Things Up Now and Then</h2>
          <p>Online, nothing is assumed to be set in stone. Raise involvement with your content and go beyond your home page refresh or to occasionally correct your About and Service pages. Exactly the same goes with any website content on your website. Archive posts that are older or upgrade posts which are still useful to visitors.</p>

          'content' : `<p>A/B testing is a quite powerful and incredibly useful method to make progress that is quantifiable to any content advertising campaign. Nevertheless, it occasionally doesn't get the attention it warrants, as a lot of people focus their attention on other techniques like Search Engine Optimization. For A/B testing, all you have to do is compare the two variants of a feature, in this instance an image, to learn which is successful and most precious based on some metrics. For instance, when sharing two pictures on media that is social, the one with the most likes will be the successful one.</p>

          <p>Yet, to ensure uniformity, it's urged that both variants of the component be examined concurrently. You might want to make routine notes about how each variant does as the evaluation progresses.</p>

          <p>Creating an A/B Test for Pictures: Google's Website Optimizer is an excellent tool for analyzing two pictures to see which is the greatest, although there are various ways to perform an A/B Test. The truth is, you can analyze up to 10 versions of a landing web page featuring numerous pictures that are distinct using this technique.</p>

          <p>You receive updates on how each picture performs and can also define what percent of visitors are contained. A simple A/B evaluation can be set up in two ways. The first is to create two variations of a picture and upload them to Google Website Optimizer. Google will pick among the two pictures before showing it to the visitor when your evaluation goes live.</p>

          <p>For every evaluation, you are going to need some kind of conversion target, which may be as easy as clicking on a picture that links to another page. After this link has been clicked by the visitor, Google will record it over some time. You can assess the results and which variation was demonstrated.</p>

          <p>A/B testing recommendations: There are several factors you should remember at all times, while A/B testing can be fairly easy and clear-cut.</p>

          <h2>1. Attempt to analyze concurrently:</h2> <p> This does not give a fair indicator of what the most powerful picture is, as you may strike it after seven days when compared to the next if you wait to examine the variation after the management.</p>

          <h2>2. Have a time limit:</h2> <p>Reason too soon, and you might not get results that are significant, complete inferior performing variations, and also late could cost you in conversions. Happily, you may use an internet calculator to determine how long to operate a test for.</p>

          <h2>3. Be consistent:</h2> <p>Make certain that specific variation is seen everywhere if an image appears in several places on your website. Ensure you do not surprise frequent clients. Use a new sample of individuals instead and show repeat visitors the same versions also.</p>

          <h2>4. Test regularly:</h2> <p>In order to optimize picture conversion rates, make sure several A/B evaluations are carried out by you. You could get tons of effects that are negative, but favorable outcomes will certainly result in success and future abundance.</p>

          <h2>5. Stick with the results:</h2> <p>Even when you favor the appearance or design of the content advertising picture that is specific, it might not prove to be the most successful. As that is the primary target, consistently select the picture that provides an improved conversion rate.</p>

          <p>It might not be possible to execute all these ideas in every A/B evaluation, but they can be bound to provide the most consistent, dependable and precise results.</p>

          'content' : `<p>For quite a long time, Search Engine Optimization has been the largest buzzword of the advertising sector. Enhancing your internet search engine functionality and procuring high positions, which connect to keywords that are selected, has been a top priority. Marketers around the world happen to be planning to attain top-notch Search Engine Optimization results from external link building and keyword density to name and meta description tags, through various means. Nevertheless, it has become clear in the past few years that nothing defeats content. Whether it is a web log post, how-to guide, content, infographic, video, case study, e-book, or e-mail newsletter, it is the strongest instrument at a marketer's disposal.</p>

          <p>When it comes to finding new content, it's clear to see that we have been spoilt for choice. Hunting for a specific subject or inputting a specific keyword will give all kinds of sources, pages, and options. So, getting the audience's focus and standing out from the crowd is of the utmost importance. Teaching and helping others make content helps in reaching this aim and will necessarily support trust. Creating valuable content should be a top priority for the marketing strategy of any brand.</p>

          <p>Here's how we can develop brand trust through content marketing.</p>

          <h2>Target set and audience goals</h2>
          <p>You'll, without a doubt, have a target audience for your products or services. When creating content, these would-be clients should be at the cutting edge of your thoughts. Who'll be reading or viewing this content? And maybe above all, why are they reading or viewing this content? If you've an absolute notion of the audience involved, it's going to be much simpler to create content that is useful and in turn, construct trust. Basically, building trust is among the first things which should be considered, which may not occur if your content feels a lot like a sales hype.</p>

          <h2>Create customized content</h2>
          <p>Customers like content that is customized, as it's tailored to their particular interests. If you make something which expressly concerns the customer, you will have an improved potential for building trust. Moreover, showing that you're a top specialist in the business with content relating to developments or current trends is an excellent means to create self-assurance. Secondly, you will need to determine the kind of content. E-mailed newsletters and case studies could be more suitable for B2B advertising, while infographics, blog posts, and videos will appeal to individual consumers.</p>

          <h2>Promotion and participation</h2>
          <p>Again, it's important to pay special attention to the promotion of content. The audience needs to be conscious that you've made something fascinating and useful, but always spamming prospective customers isn't recommended. That said, if the crowd does not see it completely or fights to get your content, there are really various reasons to trust your brand. Research what stages and stations the audience is most active on. High-level executives could be reading their e-mails early in the morning, but followers on Twitter or Facebook might not be assessing their feeds till the evening. Understanding when and where to encourage content establishes trust and will lead to greater visibility.</p>

          <p>As you need to participate and communicate with the crowd also, especially on social network, just placing content there to read and see is only half the battle. Reacting to users who have shared your content and addressing inquiries about services or products strengthens self-confidence in your business and will assure the customer. Building trust is substantially more likely if you've a personable brand that presents a human touch.</p>

          <h2>Evaluation and optimization</h2>
          <p>Take time to analyze its success after executing your content promotion strategy. There must be some strong signs about what content is seen and is being shared. And on the other hand, alternate kinds of content could have already been dismissed and rejected. With numerous analytics tools available, you also need to be capable of finding whether the first goals relating to your target market have now been reached. If not, some adjustments concerning betrothal, promotion, supply, and content might be needed. By finding out what's working and what is not, you'll be capable of optimizing your content promotion strategy to reach even better results. Keep on seeking the effective kinds of content and stages but dump the ones which are not performing.</p>

          <h2>Closing in on brand trust</h2>
          <p>There's no fast remedy or magic bullet to creating brand trust, but the procedure for spreading and creating tailor-made content does not have to be too complex. It will necessarily take time and effort and might not be simple, but the advantages and compensations can be substantial. Once trust has been created, an active audience will continue to share and view content. From here, conversions and sales are bound to rise.</p>

A powerful brand is about identity. You can't make or compose great content that is B2B without focusing on your area of expertise.</p>

          <h2>Do not Attempt to Please Everybody</h2>
          <p>Great business-to-business content writing calls for creating content which is exceptionally targeted to your audience. Frequently, issues can exhaust and run out of thoughts. This may result in dilution in content matter whereby your brand starts to create content that's not targeted to your prospective customers. In the end this may result in more web traffic, but not the quality web traffic you need to generate sales or leads.</p>

          <h2>Comprehend what kinds of Content benefit you</h2>
          <p>The content that is key to writing strong B2B is comprehending what kind of content will work in the first place for you. Without calculating the impact your content has on your brand, you risk wasting money and time on promotion tasks that don't give a return on investment to you.

Google Analytics is the most famous free tool in the world, and for a valid reason - the tool is constantly being upgraded with new attributes, and it's everything business-to-business brands and entrepreneurs need to get started with to quantify their content.</p>

Reveal to subscribers the value of signing up by telling them just what they can expect to receive when they join your e-mail program. Tell them about the kinds of offers they will receive out of your organization and be clear from the start. They are more inclined to join in the event that you make an appealing proposal. </p>

          <p>Keep your e-mail signup procedure uncomplicated, or prospective clients might walk away sooner. Reach the right balance with only the required information to provide targeted, relevant offers. Ask only for the info you need. In the event the signup procedure is easy, they are prone to subscribe; if it is challenging, they can forego the procedure completely. </p>

          <p>Youd be amazed by how frequently consumers make online purchases, only to discover the fact they have accidentally selected the option to receive e-mail offers. These are seen unfavorably by most and, more times than not, result in spam complaints, causing future e-mails to be redirected to the junk folder from the inbox. Your reputation suffers because of this. </p>

          <p>While it is important to supply simple onboarding and an excellent first impression for new clients, it is also vital to make certain the infrastructure delivering the experience is safe. E-Mail marketers are responsible not only for the procedures but in addition, they are responsible also for their subscribers experience and systems that offer those experiences. With list bombing, malware, and spam, malicious performers can negatively affect your brand by inundating receivers inboxes, which may even result in blacklistings. </p>

          <p>Signup types which are not overly difficult are likely objectives, and marketers need to seek out the right balance between protecting the brand and offering convenience for subscribers.

          <p>Here are a couple of choices to add to your signup form that could reinforce the method:</p>

          <p>The CAPTCHA does not have to be a hard condition for your subscribers. Much too frequently, websites need typing in a blend of numbers and letters, which might usually be challenging to read. An improved choice for the consumer experience is as easy as a checkbox that says "I am not a robot".</p>

          <p>Confirm opt-in requests clients, to support their alternative to opt-in to your e-mail program by clicking on a verification e-mail. While there may be a substantial drop off between first signup and verification e-mail, COI makes it feasible to validate e-mail addresses prior to adding them to your advertising stream. </p>

          <p>By doing this you add only those individuals who actually wish to receive e-mails from you and supply a positive approval. A starting point for dialogue with your brand, the e-mail signup procedure is an essential part of the consumer journey. You must get it right. Keep the procedure simple, clear-cut, and appealing to entice subscribers. Eventually, do not forget to be mindful of the mechanisms behind the procedure. By reaching the right balance between protection and customer experience, you will bring in real subscribers.</p>

Now, it’s getting the capability to personalize interactions with your brand and it has become about customer journey. Modern business to business advertising is not simple. Trustworthy connections must be built by businesses while pleasing customers with value added information that keeps them active, engaged and intrigued in pursuing products and services across platforms. The key takeaway with business to business e-mail marketing is to develop a strategy that provides proper content during each stage of the customer journey, whether it’s an infographic, survey results or product sheets and comparison guides. Here are suggestions to help you develop an email campaign that delivers results. </p>

          <p>The tone of an email sets the stage for what’s to come: it’s generally the first impression youve to make an impact. With business to consumer firms, tone is typically made to capture focus. Business to business e-mail marketing doesn’t always need to be visually amusing or appeal to emotions to be successful. The right tone for business to business e-mail marketing is more about nurturing and developing a relationship – for solving pain points, supplying a dependable alternative. For customers that are participating, content that is useful and personalized triumphs each time. At present, business to business marketer can personalize email readily through the use of information characteristics. Identify individuals by business and their name – even better, by their job in the firm. Personalization means understanding where subscribers have been in the customer journey using functionality facility information and information components if appropriate.

          'overview' : 'For many companies, the key to making sales is to first produce leads. Leads are precious because they are the people that have suggested interest that is all-natural in your content and your company.',

Leads are precious because they are the people that have suggested interest that is all-natural in your content and your company by giving you their info somehow, whether it is by filling in an application to download an e-book, finishing an online survey, or something else. Some entrepreneurs have trouble producing leads that are enough to feed their sales staff. Others create tons of leads, but they are bad leads, and your sales staff is having trouble turning them into customers.</p>

          <p>These are common issues marketers have with lead generation. In this place, well talk on how to fix them and go over several issues. Here are some lead generation errors marketers need to quit making:</p>

          <h2>You are purchasing leads, not creating them organically</h2>
          <p>It can be tempting to purchase e-mail lists so that you can feed your sales organization with something if you are having problem producing leads. The complete purpose of producing leads is to ultimately foster these leads into clients. For your leads to become clients, the leads you produce need to really want to learn from you. Your leads need to select to come in, basic and clear. This implies your contacts selected to give their advice to you in exchange for something valuable, like a content offer, event, and so forth. Concentrate on creating offers which might be precious in some way on your market, and after that set it behind a lead capture form and package that value.</p>

          <p>Growing a healthy, opt-in electronic mailing list takes some time, but it is worth its weight in gold down the line. As soon as youve folks that remain subscribed, be certain you are creating exceptional e-mail content that makes people need to really open your e-mails. </p>

          <p>You do not offer lead gen content for individuals in different phases of the buyers journey. Not everybody who sees your site is going to be in the same phase of the journey. Some of your website visitors could be prepared to purchase, but most will not, and you must give them the chances to understand more about your company before asking them to purchase something. You will need to cater to visitors whore at all different phases of the purchasers journey using CTAs to maximize clickthrough rates.</p>

          <p>Youll need to spend some time creating various offers you can put behind landing web page types that cater to individuals at different periods. People whore just beginning to get to know you may be intrigued in offers like checklists, competitions, and templates. Visitors whore a little further down the funnel could be thinking about whitepapers and e-mail classes. People even farther down could be prepared for a demo. Use smart CTAs if you need to take personalization a step farther. Smart CTAs are CTAs that change depending upon the individual viewing the page, pages seen already, her or his interests, places, services or things purchased and so on.</p>

          <h2>You are not utilizing your site to generate leads.</h2>

          <p>Among the largest advantages of business web blogging is transforming the traffic it brings you in leads. As each blog post you write is another page that is indexed, each post is a fresh chance to produce new leads. Keep blogging over time and consistently, each post you write may drive value for you in the form of traffic and leads. Rendering leads out of your website posts is straightforward: Simply add a lead creating call-to-activity to every blog post. More often than not, these CTAs may lead to squeeze pages offering free content as free trials, whitepapers, checklists, webinars, ebooks, and so forth. By web blogging about subject matters related to them, market your content offers, and after that set CTAs that lead to the landing page of the strength on every single one of these blog posts.</p>

          <h2>You are not utilizing the finest lead generation tools.</h2>
          <p>Do you know who theyre, although you know that individuals are coming to your web site? How about what they are doing btaking specific activities, before and after or once they get there? If you are unable to answer these questions, then you are going to have a difficult time associating with the individuals who are seeing your website or learning what is not and what is resonating with them.</p>

          <p>But you need the right tools to do it, although these are questions you can and may answer. There are several excellent tools out there that will help you convert them into leads and learn about your web site visitors. There are templates and several distinct tools out there thatll help you create lead gen assets that are distinct enough to put on your website.</p>

          <h2>Testing mindset.</h2>

          <p>Understanding that you should test your web site and continuously work on improving it is one thing. What most entrepreneurs have trouble with is seeing experimenting not as an easy method to show your thoughts, but as an easy method to locate something better.</p>

          <p>Generally, this will show itself in someone having a concept for how to improve a part of their site. Maybe they think conversion rates increases, for example, on that page. Treat every thought that is brought to the table the same, if you think it will win. This supports a more holistic strategy and makes the testing plan less private.</p>

          <p>You are not optimizing your main pages for lead generation</p>

          <p>You must create chances for individuals to convert on those pages, because a lot of people are getting on those pages.</p>

          <p>First, find out which of your websites are the most popular for traffic. Subsequently, optimize these pages for leads. What this means is making certain call-to-actions that stick out from the page, and after that put them where individuals naturally look on your web site. Want the conversion rate to raise on a page that already gets lots of traffic? Create unique offers especially for the pages that are the hottest, and get them behind page forms that are landing.</p>

          <h2>You are not using social network strategically for lead generation</h2>

          <p>Even though social network is most successful for top-of the funnel advertising metrics like brand and traffic recognition, it may still be useful as a source of lead generation. One method to create more leads from social network is to scatter site offers and posts which have historically generated higher than typical offers your team is creating and leads amounts for you in the new places. Ensure you are using some of the attributes on each social media which can be specifically made to assist you create leads. On Twitter, your lead gen tweets must include a brief URL linking to the site landing web page with a form, a value proposition, and a picture to ensure the station stands out. Lead generation cards that will help you create qualified leads in a lower price than majority of the other leading advertising platforms are also offered by twitter.</p>

          <p>Twitter cards allow you to embed rich media that they give over their e-mail, visit a landing page, do not count toward your tweet character limitation that enable your supporters and followers to do things such as download a program, or use a coupon, all without leaving Twitter. </p>

          <p>On Facebook, one method to readily create leads is by just utilizing the call-to-action attribute accessible for Pages. The attribute lets you set a call that is simple - on top of your Facebook Page activity button, and it could help drive more traffic out of your Facebook Page to lead generation types like contact sheets and landing pages. </p>

          <p>On LinkedIn, B2B companies may take benefit of a spot where business-to-business relationships are more than likely to be constructed, and the perception that LinkedIn is the most complex of societal stages. As on Facebook, you can print your lead creating content directly to your company Facebook Page alongside a powerful picture and actionable copy.</p>

          'overview' : 'It is no secret that we need to spend money to earn money. Whether we are buying a strong piece of software geared toward improving sales and our company reach, or we are getting one-to-one company consultation .',
          'content' : `<p>It is no secret that we need to spend money to earn money. Whether we are buying a strong piece of software geared toward improving sales and our company reach, or we are getting one-to-one company consultation and mentoring in an attempt to prepare ourselves for the next phase of growth, we are comfortable with the notion of paying for development. What company owners want is the skill to develop a sustainable path to follow into the future and surmount the challenges that increase brings, and to manage the problems. It is this concept of sustainability that is so essential to a company that is growing.</p>

          <p>Firstly, we need to understand the sources that we already have in position. With this much data to draw upon, this will often cause an embarrassment of riches. An excessive amount of information, with no robust information management strategy with which to manage it in place, can be overwhelming.</p>

          <p>Secondly, we need to know how to store that information. This cannot be difficult to realize at the beginning when our customer base is modest, and the comparative value of every customer interaction is low. However, it becomes tougher to realize as our organizations grow. When substantial increase happens, the only means to manage this information is by utilizing an all-inclusive system that may store and report on volumes of figures and facts that could be useless to the person.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, we need to know, once we have it, what exactly to do the penetration with. Attempting to use raw data without the required tools to your organization is like handling automotive repairs with your bare hands. You have to have processes and the appropriate tools set up, enabling you to bring your company wisdom to endure within your organization.

          <p>As you get to grips with using marketing automation applications to process, store and access information, you will start to see that the company is truly self-sufficient in lots of ways, especially with regards to information. The truth is, all companies are information companies on an unfathomable scale, churning a complicated array of information, every day, within an unbelievable quantity.</p>

          <p>This implies that many small companies are eating in their hard-earned gains in an attempt to obtain the resources which they have. High-priced information consultancy services, data penetration advisories, along with other bodies, supply high amounts of business wisdom to companies. Still, quite frequently, the raw material of business brains was already inside the firm the entire time. By using this data and penetration throughout the execution of business-wide automation systems, companies get the key that unlocks a wealth of gains and advantages.</p>

          <p>What is more, high-quality automation systems are scalable, working alongside and matching protocols and business processes as a firm grows.</p>

          <p>What are your business objectives? Maybe you desire to call their activities in advance, giving yourself the chance to supply what they really need before they even ask for it and to understand your customer base better? That is possible with the insight obtained through automation. Perhaps you need to cut the fat on your lead generation methods, optimizing conversions and bring in qualified leads and prospects? Automation makes this possible also. Or it might be the case that you need to run evaluations and routine audits, developing future strategies and analyzing your activities. The information coverage and analytic functions of automation applications give you the tools to achieve this economically and effectively.</p>

          <p>The landscape of the company is in continuous flux, changing and evolving before our very eyes. Improvement comes from incremental increases, small measures made over an extended period of time in the right path. As an alternative to supplying particular issues with holistic treatments, we must put on constructing a strong design that will empower us to keep competing at our greatest even as we outgrow our present markets, an extensive strategy. This really is why marketing automation actually is the present that keeps on giving. Our organizations create abundant veins of information, and it is up to us to mine these veins, getting the insight we want and tapping into them. Nobody should show us how to do that - no one should supply added information resources to us to keep our businesses going - instead, use them efficiently in operation, and only use the sources that we already have.</p>

          'content' : `<p>Marketing automation is there to scale and leverage your business; however it doesnt develop relationships for you. Its up to you to develop relationships with your customers. We need to earn their trust. You can get precious details about them, which you may use to automate your marketing communications whenever you interact with your customers and prospects. This can be particularly significant because, whenever you communicate with your audience, they may be capable of seeing how much you know about them.</p>

          <h2>Understand your marketplace</h2>

          <p>In order to know your marketplace, you first need to know what they do and who your audience is. Obviously, not everybody is your market. Understanding your audience starts by defining brand nature and your business goals.</p>

          <h2>Whore you talking to?</h2>

          <p>Despite the fact that the greatest aim is to sell more products and services, you wont be able to sell unless you speak to the buyer, the decision-maker and the right individual. So you might need to invest some time studying why and who really wants your services and products. Reacting to needs is not more difficult than creating demands, and it can make better business sense. The vital things we need in a company to make choices that are significant are data that is useful and made using common sense. Weve all seen the research that indicates the optimum time to print an article, post a picture on Instagram, to tweet or send an email.</p>

          <h2>Assess your actions</h2>

          <p>All companies are not the same. Quantify what matters to your business and also to you. Always start connecting your brand with your audience and their degree of interaction. Such strategy improves your credibility and keeps you observable. Analytics consistently help to comprehend how they express themselves and how engaged people are.</p>

          <h2>Mix common sense and data</h2>

          <p>Information and common sense together empower you to understand your audiences behaviour better. This calls for investing in the right systems as well as the ability to design the whole procedure seamlessly.</p>

          <p>You have to use the technology to make your promotion procedures considerably more efficient and to save time, but you also need to participate in real-time with your customers and prospects. Its essential to get the basics right. Its bad enough to have a marketing automation platform in place if youre not willing to participate and interact with your audience.</p>

          <h2>Overview</h2>

          <p>Marketing automation can benefit everybody, only if they place individuals above and beyond the technology. Concentrate on adding and creating value. Be important and critical; that starts with understanding why and what youd like to do. Communication channels that you are choosing come after assessing the routes and the audience behaviour.</p>

As business-to-business marketers, this metric is among the most critical for warranting our attempts (and spending budget requests) to senior management. Here are five methods through which marketing automation may help you foster your Return on Investment.</p>

          <h2>1. NURTURE PROSPECTS</h2>

          <p>Getting prospects nurtured to a sales state is a requirement since client relationships drive the purchasing cycle. There is no doubt that secret that nurturing will get you a larger yield – and to nurture based on their interactions with your content, you can automatically add prospects with a marketing automation platform.</p>

          <h2>3. GET QUALIFIED LEADS TO SALES MORE FAST</h2>

Its already correct in the template; thus this makes pre-sent reviews easier too. This uniformity also indicates that you wont forget significant components that lead to getting the results you are expecting.</p>

          <h2>4. Normalize your Information</h2>

          <p>Individuals dont consistently fill forms the same manner out. Marketing automation may help you ensure consistent data in specific areas. Its possible for you to construct your subjects with dropdowns to ensure correct entrance or you can automate the procedure on the backend for one. Cleaning this info up is a major help to segmenting for higher conversion rates, understanding your prospects, as well as reporting.</p>

          <h2>5. Remove Inactive Contacts</h2>

          <p>The purpose to build a marketing database is not to have the most absolute number of contacts. You are more intrigued in engaged and active contacts that lead to company results. Due to this you should not be frightened to remove contacts from your database. Removing these records will streamline your procedures and enable you to concentrate on contacting those possibilities that have a real curiosity about products or your services.</p>

            <p>Looking out onto the horizon, there are unprecedented opportunities to transform how businesses interact with their clients. The main thing a brand may do to set itself aside from others is to give strong and favorable encounters to customers. Often brands are overly focused on advertising, messaging, and trades, without looking at what sort of experience clients are having with them, and that is an enormous error. </p>

            <p>If consumers are profoundly linked to affiliate empowering and positive experiences with a brand, and an organization, they are going to be much more likely to repeat business and more inclined to share their encounters with others.

            <p>Every network, every service and every program is instructing us that we are the centre of the universe. Members of the younger generation reside in a globe where everything, from amusement to marketing and social networking, is personalized. Companies now have a chance to serve a generation of self-centered consumers, which may drive technology-pressured brands to be more empathetic and to be more human. A self-centered market gives businesses an insight into how individuals act, how individuals communicate and share, what they find fascinating, and what they anticipate. This mixture of elements should inspire companies to develop relationships that are real. </p>

            <p>Behaviors and customer expectations are changing radically as a consequence of disruptive technology. This may induce innovation and dislocation at each level in every company. </p>

            <p>Naturally, businesses confront many previous and future challenges.

In a team, the part that is most critical is that of the optimization and customization team member who coordinates targeting or testing tasks across all touchpoints that are digital and supervises the roadmap. This function can be critical in conveying insights and results across the more comprehensive team and reorganizing the map of approaching actions. Other significant functions comprise a content designer/creator, an executive sponsor, and maybe even for examining more complex features such as site or program functionality. </p>

            <p>To maximize your scalability via an assembly line of personalization and optimization tasks, you need to have an established procedure for quality assurance, validation, creation, development, execution, and reporting of actions. Eventually, it is significant that you routinely gather thoughts both from qualitative analyses and quantitative evaluations and that cost-benefit analyses subsequently run as well to differentiate these actions with respect to what holds for the most value. When both the business and digital model are in position, the optimization and customization option should be everywhere you put content, empowering you to answer your entire evaluation theories and build your personalization strategy with the truth born from examining the right data and getting the penetrations out of your reports. </p>

            <p>Preferably, your analytics option operates alongside the personalization option and your optimization to surface regarding where you will need to examine a more personalized experience. When automation is called for, this might be extremely strong. Attributes like contribution evaluation and anomaly detection within Adobe Analytics, for instance, show the most likely root causes of this behavior as well as an audience that is deviating from the mean substantially when it comes to participation. Using server-to-server integration that comes with a personalization and optimization option like Adobe Target, sharing synchronized information, and a unified progressive profile, this very same crowd section may be shared into a test to look for the best way of reengagement. That is where analytics and real-time penetrations work hand-at hand with optimization and customization to make you more flexible to changing styles and also to keep you from missing any crowd that might be functioning with you at any given stage in the customers journeys.</p>

            <p>Let us say you suddenly have lots of traffic from a YouTube video that is particular, but it is not converting. Smart tools will help you recognize more about why that crowd isnot converting as well as disclose how that crowd is acting appreciably distinct from how web site visitors typically act. That info may lead to optimized personalization that can help the crowd overcome this barrier. You can also save this crowd as a special section. You know a YouTube video inspired them to click through to your website, although not to convert. </p>

            <p>Running an A/B evaluation will help you analyze the right path to learning more about the crowd. Personalization could be as easy as pressing on a retargeting campaign as well as the formerly mentioned personalized landing web page. In case of retargeting, the option shouldnot only provide abundant information and availability optimization and personalization through your business, but additionally be in a position to be executed within all your digital platforms, literally, everywhere you put content. This includes internet sites, offsite in e-mails and partner sites, in mobile applications, as well as on internet-connected devices and displays.</p>

            <p>Personalization and optimization tools, like Adobe Target, may enable marketers, analysts, and customer support specialists to act on data-driven insights into whats working for particular crowds, and even for particular people, and upgrade their digital encounters in real time to coincide with their settings. Leveraging real-time information, alongside the total contextual perspective of analytics for taking actions on testing, personalizing to common crowds, or drilling down with the total weight of the data analyses, can boost your self-assurance in qualifying your content modification choices.

Leaders create a continuing platform for brand advertising that incorporates all touchpoints with individual KPIs, budgets, and aims—all finally linking back to a single set of overarching brand targets.</p>

            <p>Powerful brands go far beyond knowing their goals; they preserve and create a high-level comprehension of their customers and how they act across a wide variety of routes. When assessing the status of a brands crowd attempts, there are three crucial areas to address: customer journey and segmentation, devotion and lifetime value optimization, and Client Relationship Management (CRM) and messaging.<p>

            <p>For a brand to keep an intimate understanding of its consumer, customer segmentation, and customer journey mapping must go hand available.</p>

            <p>After the entirety of the encounter between a brand and its followers across all touchpoints is created and comprehended (customer journey mapping), the general customer base must be broken up into unique and related goals (customer segmentation).</p>

            <p>Customer loyalty is crucial. The most powerful brands develop plans and campaigns early on that move a high number of prospects to purchasers, and after that to brand promoters and loyalists, in a brief period. Modern brands ought to be able to leverage their customer and prospect information readily, allowing for an entire comprehension of sections and individuals. Doing so not only educates timely and targeted messaging, but enables personalized and optimized interactions with consumers and possibilities that become very important. Modern consumers crave one-to-one, and real encounters and messaging ensure brands can close the gap between the customer and themselves.</p>

            <p>A powerful communications strategy not only drives sales and brand visibility but also strategically links and sections the brand. Products and excellent services can only scale with a strategy that is correctly defined and executed communications. While tactically, paid media includes attempts like paid search, display, retargeting, and paid societal attempts to encourage content and drive traffic to properties that are owned, it is the way these various attempts work collectively that optimize Return on Investment and ensure brands succeed.</p>

            <p>Brands that succeed can bring in word of mouth through innovation, quality, and relevancy. A high-quality encounter and merchandise that disturbs the marketplace are bound to create word of mouth with consumers eventually. To expedite this attempt, drive exposure through press attempts, and use technology in new ways.</p>

            <p>The key to an effective channel strategy is ensuring that you are accounting for how your content will come to life across all your owned properties: web site, stations that are societal, program, newsletter, etc. Its not easy to reach a balance between ensuring that youre optimizing the content for the station youre delivering it on and needing to get the most out of a bit of content. Brands have a profound comprehension of the nuances of leveraging their various stations that are owned for exposure and maximum participation.</p>

            <p>The means of connecting with consumers, quantifying insights, and assessing the consumer journey are constantly in flux. With the appearance of shifts and new platforms in customer behavior comes the importance of brands to leverage technology to adjust to ever-changing priorities, rather than letting technology define the restraints of how their customers are engaged with by brands. They can not only quantify touchpoints across their ecosystems but can derive insights and make conclusions that are actionable readily. That isnt about leveraging sophisticated and high-priced analytics platforms, but about defining and focusing on important KPIs across the whole customer journey.</p>

            <p>The consumer should be at the cutting edge of every technology choice made in the organization. Technology functions as a competitive differentiator in empowering the brand to better connect with crowds and supply a first-class experience. No brand can flourish without prioritizing its user experience across all devices. As mobile has overtaken desktop computer use, its insufficient to create encounters that are mobile-centric, and they also need to be quickly and made for the on the go consumer.</p>

            'content' : `<p>Mobile digital media use is currently outpacing the use of desktop computers by 51 to 42 percent and is definitely on the rise. What're consumers doing with mobile access? They are reading their emails. Over 50% of all emails now viewed are opened on mobile devices. As a marketer, your mobile marketing plan needs to be powerful, and your mobile campaign should look different out of your background variant.</p>

            <p>Need a refresher? Here are five simple but very successful suggestions for designing mobile email marketing campaigns that are friendly.</p>

            <h2> Hint 1: Examine The Data, Understand Your Audience.</h2>
            <p>Before committing time, effort, and cash into mobile advertising design, it is useful to know where the bulk of your subscribers are, what they are doing, how they see your emails, how many of them are using mobile devices, and which devices they are using.</p>

            <p>Each customer differs, and with lots of variants to design for, like comprehension, email program, apparatus, as well as actions individuals are engaged, may help you determine how complex to make your mobile design.</p>

            <h2>Hint 2: Simplify Subscriber Encounter, Optimize Layout and Functionality.</h2>
            <p>The driving force behind all email advertising campaigns is that it is a subscriber encounter. The first thing to think about with cell phone advertising is the topic line. Ensure it remains convincing and concise.</p>
            <p>Is the start of the theme line powerful enough? Could you read it, and could you comprehend what it is about without needing to turn your phone sideways? Make sure to design within a column format, as it is much simpler to scroll down and up through content without needing also to scroll right or left. Simplify user experience through functionality and design, and mobile advertising success will follow.</p>

            <h2>Hint 3: Use Clear Call to Action and Allow It To Be Simple to Click.</h2>
            <p>Promotional emails can be quite long. However, with mobile, the key to success is the brevity. There is no need to elaborate on mobile. How do you get your message across fast? With a single, clear, proactive approach, that is how. There is an improved chance they will do it when subscribers know exactly what they have been expected to do. A lot of links can be diverting. The main call to action, with a simple-to bug on link; is everything you need. Avoid using a font that is large or hard to read or making pictures into links.</p>

            <h2>Hint 4: Use Whitespace, Give Some Room to Content.</h2>
            <p>Mobile content functions best when it is spaced. Recall, it is demanding to see everything on the mobile, so be sure to allow for lots of whitespaces to give the text some breathing room. Again, finger size is taken by the greatest email designed for mobile into account. Whitespace around links is not bad. Someone frustrates over an accidental click, except, maybe, two clicks that are random.

            <h2>Hint 5: Consider Circumstance - Capitalize on Freedom.</h2>
            <p>Mobile presents a wonderful chance to capitalize on contextual email because people now are on the go.</p>

            <p>If you know your audience members are probably viewing your email while they may be doing something different, it is practical to design content that is unique for that case. The good thing is, to be successful with mobile advertising, the email does not need to be drawn out and long, but operates best when it is insightful and brief. Think of email that is as contextual as supplying a service. Nearly 50% of consumers said they d receive a promotion message via email than direct mail. The right email can preview the event, share information about where to park, as well as emphasize where to catch dinner before or after the show if you know your clients are going to a ballgame or concert.</p>

            <p>Your customers can be reached by excellent contextual emails designed for mobile at the moment with info that is strong. Mobile email marketing isn t simple. You just want the strategies that are right to do it nicely. By understanding your audience and examining the data, you can target customers with mobile design, which makes sense for them with messaging that is simple to comprehend and act upon once they want it most.</p>

            'content' : `<p>Marketing can be utilized as a revenue flow by 38% of mobile program developers, far higher than another source. Still, the bulk of programmers pursuing the money in marketing are not making much cash. So what type of programmer persists in embedding advertisements when the real cash is elsewhere? Scalability and the simplicity of marketing are not resistible to programmers that are cash strapped. But whenever we break the amounts down by programmer section, some more intriguing patterns emerge. The first wave of mobile applications mostly required payments to download - users were asked for a couple of dollars that was accumulated by the program store.</p>

            <p>That led to a race to the bottom, as higher quality opponents were supplanted by more low-cost applications and the price of developing a mobile program immediately become untenable. The alternative was marketing, sponsoring content inside the program or embedding in the program as it ran, to cover the price of development. That worked for some time, but the marketing sales were spread more thinly as the business grew in size. In program buying is a basis of the majority of games, several other mobile applications, and now another option also. Programmers are not pinning their hopes on one sales model anymore; theyre taking cash.</p>

            <p>You can find two groups of programmers using marketing as a revenue source - those seeking scalability and simplicity of being the next big thing as they dream, and those that have added marketing as yet another revenue stream to top up their income. Very few programmers manage to emulate that degree of success, although the scalability and simplicity make marketing appealing. For the second group, marketing is more feasible - that may be facilitated by offering a premium, variant for all those that select to pay, although the only threat is the possible alienation of users. For many programmers, the income from advertisements can form part of the sales combination, which blends to form a sustainable business. Marketing is not the fairy dust it was previously, but neither can it be blown off as part of the sales combination that is mobile, as its become for many programmers.</p>

            'overview' : 'Creating a program that is useful takes considerably more than an interesting thought. What is needed instead is the proven methods that help drive engagement that is better for the program.',
            'content' : `<p>Creating a program that is useful takes considerably more than an interesting thought. What is needed instead is the proven methods that help drive engagement that is better for the program. These are not tricks, and a few of them require considerable thought and effort. If you put in the time, they are going to work through. With that, here are 10 strategies that help their program engagement numbers to improve.</p>

            <h2>Craft a leading app store listing</h2>
            <p>Why are we beginning with a component outside the program itself? Participation begins with what is in the app and first interaction of your user with your program store itself. If your program is not downloaded by anyone, in lots of ways, that is the worst kind of participation. Spend some time to think about why folks will desire even to give your program the opportunity. What issues are you attempting to solve? How do you use your program? Concentrate on benefits not attributes just as much as possible. Hopefully, there are comments from examiners that may also determine what you use within the application store listing. It is also helpful to often look at programs that are featured. They generally provide great inspiration for app store listings that are nicely done.</p>

            <h2>Train users with onboarding</h2>
            <p>Your onboarding encounter is the first dialogue you have with prospective users if an application store listing is a handshake. With onboarding, you're trying to utilize your program and to really get them interested in it. A standard error is using onboarding expertise to educate individuals on how to use a program. Because there is no acquaintance with your program yet your onboarding encounter shouldnt be a tutorial. Instead, continue to concentrate on training users about the advantages of your program.</p>

            <h2>Let users try before they buy</h2>
            <p>Programs that need some type of authentication or login, particularly a societal login like Facebook, should never need that to be used upfront. Instead, allow users to explore your program just as much as possible and only need authenticating when needed or while signing up. This strategy carries on to build the thought of demonstrating the value of your program before a user actually has to devote himself to it . The easy method to approach this issue is that in a read-only mode or a browse, no user needs to authenticate. Right as the user needs to perform an activity, they will get motivated to create an account.</p>

            <h2>Follow best practices for program permission requests</h2>

            <p>As weve detailed in the past, it is important to do the right thing to permission requests. Otherwise, users may yet again discourage into instantly deleting your program. The recommendations we propose, as summarized in our article on this subject, contain thinking about time, context, tone, vocabulary, and messaging. It is also vital that you have a plan to deal with users who, whether purposefully or by mistake, refuse these permissions requests. Hampered expertise can rapidly lead to your program being deleted and wont show off your programs value propositions.</p>

            <h2>Do not forget about push notifications</h2>

            <p>Programs that go quiet for long time periods are eventually deleted and can be forgotten about. That does not mean you should spam users, but you must think about important push tellings that bring them back into your program. It is possible to target users that have performed specific activities, platforms, devices, and more. They certainly should be integrated into your participation strategy though pushes arent a gleaming new attribute.</p>

            <h2>Go deeply with deep linking</h2>

            <p>Tellings, whether via drive or SMS, are even more strong using a deep connection in your program. We particularly love to use a deep linking when it is helpful to get someone to a particular place in a program or when encouraging other users to a program. For deep linking, Google, Apple, and others are continuing to commit in their strategies.</p>

            <h2>Allow it to be simple to contact you</h2>

            <p>Comments from users are the lifeblood of an easy method and your program to raise participation. However, so many make it simply difficult to get in contact with them. Those responses are subsequently placed by users directly as opposed to sharing it with you through an application store review.</p>

            'content' : `<p>Push messages are sent to users when the app is not being used by them with the hopes of persuading them to return. On the other hand, in-app messages have proven to be an excellent way to improve a users experience while they may be actively utilizing the app. Individualization means choosing messages beyond personalization, that was more focused on using fundamental user info such as first name or language setting into a new land.</p>

            <p>Apps using in-app messaging gain in two significant ways: higher retention and higher participation. Apps have taken the initiative to improve the user experience with in-app messaging to see that it will pay off with both of these essential metrics. Apps have to take a much more granular strategy, although using in-app messaging is an excellent start.</p>

            <p>Presenting an in-app message away from an event is more innovative and powerful strategy while these kinds of in-app messages can be successful. This enables an application to participate with users based on the activities they send and take more messages that are useful to them.</p>

            <h2>Take it one step further - section messages with the crowd.</h2>
            <p>It is also essential to take the segmentation one step farther and show appropriate audiences messages based on unique profile info, while it is significant to activate from an event within in-app messages. That is where a completely round approach that is personal comes in. This means first choosing an activity for the in-app message to be activated away from, but additionally revealing an audience that meets specific criteria.</p>

            <p>Apps across vertical sectors that are different experience raises that are distinct in participation when they contain profile characteristics and activate their in-app messages off of an event. Retail apps over double their speeds that are clicked when they have an audience compared to a note revealed at the beginning of a session and in-app messages activated by an event. Each time a user adds specific merchandise to their favourites, list or checks in a shop in a place that is particular, they have been reinforcing their profile, which the apps subsequently profit from.</p>

            <p>Another time a user is in the app, if they go to click a promotion they might be met with a note describing the promotion for their favourite products in the store, they formerly have seen. The skill to give this kind of message that is unique based on the advice related to that user that is precise is why so much success has been found by these apps. The success translates to nearly two times as many clicks through conversions of those messages being revealed as compared to messages seen at the beginning of a session within the first 24 hours.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In-app is emerging as a force to be reckoned with regards to app users that are participating. And given the present app market that is hyper-competitive, marketers need every tool possible to distinguish themselves from the mess. Additionally, marketers need to use the data all available on their users to deliver really personalized messages at their fingertips.</p>

            'content' : `<p>Keep program users happy and engaged with these 5 tips for raising program retention:</p>

            <h2>1. Personalization</h2>
            <p>People are totally obsessed with themselves, and catering to this natural narcissism goes a significant way in winning over people. Never pass up a chance to integrate personalization into your program, whether through referencing a user’s previous purchase behaviour, place, or name.</p>
            <p>Include these personalized touches via drive notifications, emails, and in-application messaging. You may even give a customized experience with content, making certain to give useful, valuable content that fits a user’s needs that are identifying. Such award-winning encounters are what keep program retention high.</p>

            <h2>2. Track Uninstalls</h2>
            <p>Some people are going to leave your program, but understanding why their left your program will empower other users to be saved by you in the future.

            <p>Common reasons for uninstalling are:</p>
            <p>Nasty UX: Ensure you have a delightful appearing UX design and intuitive navigation.</p>
            <p>Bugs: Bugs don’t only frustrate users – they also reflect that the program isn’t trustworthy and secure.</p>
            <p>Seasonality: Some applications, like child or wishlist applications -friendly park locators, may have a specific seasonality about them.</p>

            <p>Don’t worry too much about these uninstalls, but consider emailing users that are old next season to see if they’re intrigued in your improved version!</p>

            <p>New & upgrades variants: Updating your program gives you a chance to add attributes that are new or missing and build upon the responses you’ve received from users. However, in some scenarios, specific sections of users might reject your new and improved variant, especially if you’ve made significant overhauls to the program object, or design, navigation. Attempt to get comments from all these abandoners to see just what drove them away.</p>

            <h2>3. Plan Ahead</h2>
            <p>Raising program retention isn’t just about understanding why users uninstall your program – it’s also important to understand the personas of your program abandoners. You can find several excellent tools out there that do the thinking for you.</p>

            <h2>4. Sell Smarter:</h2>
            <p>Many users uninstall programs as a consequence of messaging that are spam or unrelated. Make certain you are not sending press messages for kicks and giggles out - your marketing campaigns have a definite target and should be highly optimized. Brush up on best practices for press notifications and consistently contain CTAs that are strong in your copy in order to give users the next step to take. Take benefit of all of the advertising tools at your disposal like email etc. An email is an untapped tool for communicating with users beyond the program.</p>

            <p>Utilize it smartly and moderately to keep users subscribed. Rich media can be shown by android telephones and now iOS10 within their push notifications. This can be an incredibly strong method to foster drive and participation users back into the program, so be sure you take benefit of it. Ensure your advertising consistently. Not to mention, measure and track everything you send to ensure you know what is working and what is not.</p>

            <h2>5. Test and Measure The Appropriate Metrics</h2>
            <p>You should be continuously testing and monitoring to ensure you are always giving users to you the best of the best. Every program differs, and every crowd has needs that are exceptional. Do not just go by practices that are best - assess if specific strategies work for you or not and experiment. Put simply, A/B evaluation. It is also vital that you look past straightforward metrics like clicks and locate methods to quantify metrics which are more aligned to your company aims, such as conversions, sales, and participation. Your message to follow through will click, but lots of others will just close out of your message and open the program themselves. This shows as easy click speeds do not consistently reveal the accurate operation of a messaging campaign, and how clicks could be a misleading metric. Testing, accurately quantifying your advertising efforts, and monitoring will assist you in developing program retention, and as a result, better campaigns.</p>

            'content' : `<h2>1.	Being uncertain on device support and OS</h2>
            <p>Turning in a suggestion thats brief on detail endangers your relationship with the customer. Deviating too far from your first approximation can kill a job instantaneously, regardless of how close to locked up it might appear; thus ensure that the contract suggests variation, apparatus, and OS support. What may be done in order to prevent this from occurring is to establish clear expectations about development prices, including a break down by OS, apparatus, and variation in the job range, from the start.</p>

            <h2>2.	Beginning development without an official change request procedure</h2>
            <p>Anticipate your customers without changing the timeline to need at least minute alterations during the job. Roaming too far from the agreed project scope will cost money and time, as even minute alterations accumulate. Describe upfront changes that increase price and development time. Create an official request procedure for any changes to your agreed-upon project scope that should be done in order to prevent this kind of blunder.</p>

            <h2>3.	Reusing old code</h2>
            <p>From your own customers point of view, it appears completely practical to reuse old code to conserve both cash and time. Unfortunately, unless the code was written recently, and was made specifically to be reused, it might take you more time than if you just wrote what you needed from the start to build upon this old code. To solve this scenario, prevent reusing code that you didnt write yourself.</p>

            <h2>4.	Establishing and time expectation for technology characteristics that are sophisticated</h2>
            <p>Its tempting to give positive development approximations for sophisticated attributes like Content management system, but what makes them happy throughout the pitch, can become a point of contention once the job schedule starts to stretch. Be upfront about attribute prices and development time, and use that as a chance to clarify why its complicated. In case time or the price for a characteristic stays a hard point, ensure whether that attribute helps achieve them, and you understand their business targets for the program, or if its better left out from the program completely. No need to recreate the wheel — many innovative features are more affordable and better through a 3rd party. Carnival, for instance, supplies a mobile marketing automation stage for sending push notifications, adding a custom message stream, sophisticated targeting, and analytics). Be realistic about costs and development time for sophisticated attributes, and ensure that for every complicated attribute, it is necessary to reach out to your customers program to prevent this error.</p>

            <h2>5.	Ill-defined User Acceptance Testing. Defining the range of User</h2>
            <p>Acceptance testing is incredibly important to ensure your improvement wraps up in a way that is timely, efficient. Program examiners supply comments too late, or that join quality assurance at the last minute and piecemeal, are a programmers nightmare. Ask that their testing group is specified by your customer, then establish a schedule for comments and revisions, before inputting UAT. Be sure your user acceptance testing procedure is coordinated by defining a schedule for revisions, bug tracker, and the testing group before beginning the testing period to prevent this error.</p>

            <h2>6.	No plan for post launching bugs</h2>
            <p>Despite your best attempts in UAT, a bug has managed to slip throughout the breaks, has become live in your program, and the customer needs it to be fixed by you. Ensure youve an understanding in place for all those moments when an error really is not your fault so that you may be compensated for the work. Even when your bug is the fault, you must have protection from it never-ending after the app was taken for repairing. It is totally okay to offer the customer a guarantee period restricted to 2-4 weeks of free support.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, set aside a line item in your contract for post-launch testing and support fees. Make certain the customer and you discuss and consent to post-launch support policies, stipulating for what amount of time. Suppose any scenario you do not cover, and be methodical about this is one you will be repairing for free. This may assist prevent a disaster.</p>

There is lots of info out there on what you should A/B evaluation and who to target, but beginners could have a difficult time getting started. How do I run my first A/B evaluation? This guide will show you the way if you are concerned about running your first A/B. In fact, the A/B testing procedure is fairly straightforward: develop a theory, pick your crowd, gather data, and examine the results. Let us break these steps down to see just how worry-free A/B testing can be.</p>

            <p>Every great science experiment begins with a theory. With no theory, it cannot be easy to distil raw data into insights. As an example, a mobile app publisher might need to examine the effectiveness of a brand new onboarding stream versus a classic one. Maybe the new stream was created to be easy to skim and visual. In this scenario, the theory could be that individuals will find it more easy to parse the clean, visually interesting flow, leading to a higher rate of Daily Users and more onboarding ends. Based on your aims, the theory cannot be even more general.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the new onboarding flow may be more lucrative with one audience over another. You do not have to target your whole user base with every A/B evaluation. The truth is, you may see better outcomes if you only examine changes with particular sections of your users, assuming that the theory takes this into account. You are prepared to discover which user section will assist you to solve it once you have determined on the issue you are attempting to solve. The procedure for setting up the A/B evaluation will change dependant upon your platform of choice. The A/B testing applications will compute the chances that the distinction between the two versions isnt only a result of random chance after accumulating enough samples.</p>

            <p>Once a particular threshold is passed by the chances, the change is deemed to be of statistical significance, meaning that it was a modification in the program that drove the distinction in results. It is advisable to analyze all statistically significant changes, not only the ones you had been monitoring. Remember that information has its uses if you are concerned about an A/B evaluation.</p>

            'overview' : 'Entrepreneurs and businesses are currently buying trustworthy mobile program development associate for developing mobile programs of all kinds based on latest technologies.',
            'content' : `<p>Entrepreneurs and businesses are currently buying trustworthy mobile program development associate for developing mobile programs of all kinds based on latest technologies. If youre planning to develop your very own mobile app or web site for company growth, all that you need is to locate the programmers of the mobile program that are at the top and consult with them on your company or product idea. In the extremely competitive digital marketplace of today, only a mobile app created specifically according to your company needs may get better functionality, increased company sales and higher gains.</p>
           <p>The initial question that customers consistently ask a development company is how much time does it takes to construct a program. Even though services have worked on different jobs and on special timelines, they were not able to quote a precise time or cost associated with a job. The construct time of a program depends upon the number of variables, like kind of delivery periods/variants, platform, program, budget constraints, functionality, attempt and cash the user needs to spend on UX & UI.</p>

           <h2>Extent of Work
           <p>This period covers the entire planning, understanding and documentation of programmers to be allocated on the job, technology to be used, budget constraints and estimated timeline.</p>
           <p>A team of analysts working on a job will break down the program into parts that are actionable. As these integrations take many months to be executed correctly in this case, the programmer must be alert to your requirements and specifications.</p>

           <h2>Attributes
           <p>Every single cellular program nowadays, has some exceptional characteristics designed for special target users and connected with them - the more number of attributes exist, the more complicated the program will be.</p>
           <p>There is a minimal difference between a complicated program and a simple program. An easy program can be a program with few screens, less database, and largely inactive information. On the other hand, a complicated program can be one thats a real-time manipulation of dynamic information and complicated database design. An easy program is something where you have a defined set of construction, a platform to be utilized, attributes to be incorporated, development methodology, layouts, wireframes, each and everything is frozen before a programmer begins working on a job. Such applications need time to finish and less effort. You will not be confident on which platform you need to develop your intended market, your program, wireframes, layouts and development methodology with the restraints of a complicated program. If these things are not finalized at the start, then the programmer will be in trouble. So one must have appropriate comprehension of the job, which then reduces your development price. Advanced attributes take more time as it needs programmers to do some exceptional coding that leads to scalable programs being correctly executed.</p>

           <h2>User Experience and Interface
           <p>UX and UI are among the key elements within a program that discovers how a user is going to communicate with the program. Both these components are extremely critical in developing work and product mutually and collectively. The function of a UX analyzer is difficult, quite complicated and multifaceted. Hes in charge of coordinating with programmers and designers until the performance of a job, wireframing and prototyping and doing competitor analysis of a job, developing merchandise construction and stream. His purpose is to meet necessities, and customer needs through a procedure for iterations and evaluation, which meets both sides of the association. Unlike a UX analyzer, the part of UI designers can be demanding and very strenuous. User Interface designers are considerably more redirected towards the feel and look of an item, constructing interactive interfaces, creating top-quality reactive layouts and branding guidelines. Both UX and UI plays a crucial part in the success of an item. So depending on the sophistication and the amount of work in a job, this phase may take months or several weeks.</p>

           <h2>Development
           <p>Developing a program isnt a job that is difficult. Whether youre developing for any platform or iOS, Android, Windows, skilled and technically sound professionals are needed for the successful performance of a job. Each one of these technologies follows their very own design requirements and runs on various programming languages like Swift Java for Android, for iOS and so forth. Different elements impact the business of mobile program development. Sophistication in the quality of programmers working on a job determines the time needed for the development. With all the tools, frameworks, libraries necessary skill and an accessible set, if there are communication obstacles inside the team or with the client, then it is difficult for a programmer to code. Occasionally, it depends upon clients, if youll find more iterations to arrive at a job from his side, then additionally the job gets delayed. To prevent these roadblocks in a job, it is better if youve got a cellular program at heart or a particular document.</p>

            'content' : `<p>Here are a couple of program store guidelines you could remember.</p>

            <h2>1. Make certain there arent any links that are broken</h2>
            <p>Anticipate if the links included inside the program are broken and if they are likely to really be rejected on the program store and dont work.</p>

            <h2>2. Lost info</h2>
            <p>Your sales pitch to future users is the information they read in the programs description. More than the possible danger of having your program rejected, you risk reducing the no of users who install the program. By getting the content in order, this could be avoided by you.</p>

            <h2>3. Prevent submitting duplicate apps</h2>
            <p>In case the program has been rejected before, its not smart to submit it again under another name, design, theme. There would need to be new attributes that would make the difference. Otherwise, the application will be rejected again. In addition, contemplate improving the user experience so more users would find it useful as opposed to merely a market.</p>

            <h2>4. Never underestimate optimization of the app store</h2>
            <p>Similar to search engine optimization for web sites, investing money and time into this would make your program more observable. This can be critical throughout the first period where the program is yet to start developing traction. Paid acquisition of users can also be a trick which could increase program downloads quickly. If you are well-financed, the scenario changes.</p>

            <h2>5. Review the payload size</h2>
            <p>Its known to most users that installing a lot of applications can slow down the apparatus due to memory consumption. The lesser space your program takes on users, the better.</p>

            <h2>6. Concentrate on supplying a useful and distinctive experience</h2>
            <p>Dont blow off the other applications which are already present in the class you will upload to. In case your program is quite comparable to the others, users might consider it useless at all times, and the application might be rejected as well.</p>

            <h2>7. Streamline or fix user enrolment procedure</h2>
            <p>Its always great to execute social network integration in the user signup process. In the event you selected not to do that, the signup procedure should be simple to comprehend for all users.</p>

            <h2>8. Give value to logo design</h2>
            <p>Creativity could make a huge difference in marketing your program. It gives a distinguishing look to the program. A catchy logo design will make the program look useful and more visible to users.</p>

            <h2>9. Address problems mentioned in evaluations and reviews</h2>
            <p>Even when your program has 3 or 4 stars out of 5, havoc can be wreaked by a number of poor reviews at the top. New users whore about to download the program see the new ones first. Even when itll take time to make those changes, you must have at least reacted to those users. That could be more inclined to download your program and is an indicator of dedication for other users.</p>

            'title':'Confused on when you should use mobile test automation?',
            'overview' : 'The conventional procedure for analyzing applications can be cumbersome and long. That is particularly true in mobile, as there is an extensive assortment of attributes and apparatus you need to account for with program testing.',
            'content' : `<p>The conventional procedure for analyzing applications can be cumbersome and long. That is particularly true in mobile, as there is an extensive assortment of attributes and apparatus you need to account for with program testing. Practical test automation, which, when correctly planned and carried out, can be a real time saver. By catching errors in the code early in the procedure; additionally, it may save your program development team some real problems later. Mobile test automation works on the chain of evaluations that are programmed that checks the likely behaviour of the attributes to the real consequences.</p>

            <p>You know that you have significantly reduced the likelihood of having any bugs if the results are aligned. If there is a distinction, the QA team could determine the issue and fixes can be identified by the development team, and then tests are rerun before the program goes into production. Where theres manual testing for different user scenarios, this automation can be an excellent complement to conventional strategies of QA. And often, it can reduce the quantity of manual testing the QA team needs to execute.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, test automation that is mobile does need some upfront time investment. And carrying it out correctly is not a matter of just deciding to do it, you need individuals whore proficient in executing and defining the evaluations. In addition, you need the tests to run. It needs an understanding by your team of what to expect from it, and how to put it to use, for it to actually work for the job.</p>

            <p>Thus before getting started with automated testing to your program, here are five questions you should think about!</p>

            <h2>How long will it take to develop your program and how long will it reside?
            <p>The more complicated it is and the longer a job will take, the greater the advantage of using evaluations that are automated. Like any merchandise, more sophistication in a program implies more possible bugs that may be launched, and having an effective way of testing various situations becomes more critical. Additionally, if you will want regular upgrades and have an app that is going to be used for an extended time, there is an important advantage to mechanically analyzing for each new release and creating practical evaluations. But if youre creating a pretty simple program that may only be used for a brief amount of time, you may be okay only utilizing a QA strategy that is more conventional.</p>

            <h2>Can be your program in the initial phases of growth?</h2>

            <p>While you generally need to plan at the beginning of a job for mobile test automation, you do not need to apply the evaluations too soon in the development procedure. Particularly if the characteristics of the program are liable to change, making changes to the performance means you will also need to make modifications to your automation evaluations, which could cancel the efficiency increase of using test automation that is mobile. If your attribute set that is early is solidified, even when you believe you might later add attributes that are new, that is the ideal time to start assembling in test automation. Actually, among the most readily useful facets, automated tests are with regression testing, where you could make sure as you add those attributes that the new old attributes are still working.</p>

            <h2>Is mobile test automation a great fit for the programs attributes?</h2>

            <p>Not all attributes of your program are worth being automated. For instance: A characteristic that calls for the camera apparatus must be examined on a physical apparatus since this cant be readily simulated by accessible tools. You all need to perform evaluations by physically pressing on the button to take a picture and seeing if the activity results in a recorded picture. With a few attributes, you risk spending more time by automating than performing the tests manually. And in the end, you cannot rely on test automation to supply results that are trustworthy and great coverage for these kinds of characteristics. To help ascertain whether to use test automation, contemplate the following ratio: the intricacy of automating a characteristic vs the value of that functionality vs the chance of a user experiencing bugs. If a characteristic is not simple to automate, but its a vital part of the experience of the user and contains a significant relationship to other options that come with the program, then using mobile test automation is the right choice. But if the attribute is not simple to automate and users of the program will only put it to use in an extremely special scenario, it might not be worth the attempt of creating automated tests for the attribute.</p>

            <h2>Does your program have persistent characteristics?</h2>

            <p>In many programs, you could have persistent attributes that enable you to use comparable test automation or the same across those characteristics. By way of example, if an application asks for a user to enrol according to age, the following screen may change based on the selection a user makes. By repeating the same evaluation through test automation, but with the distinct varieties by age causing an alternate screen, but you can examine the enrolment page entry. For these attributes, automated testing is pretty easy to use through multiple user scenarios, while testing that is manual might be persistent and time-intensive.</p>

            <h2>Will your program be compatible with multiple systems and devices?</h2>

            <p>Most of the time, mobile programs are developed to serve a wide variety of screen sizes and device types. Using mobile test automation is much more significant, particularly because of how time intensive it may be to manually carry out the evaluations on every one of the different apparatus if your program was created for many devices. But if your program is a pretty simple program that is only designed for an individual system, you might discover that utilizing automated program testing takes more time than doing conventional QA.</p>

            <p>We talked about instances where each is most suitable whenever we discussed program monetization strategies above. Once your program is started, a lot of instances can be demonstrated with data; for instance, users have long sessions in the application or visit the application often.</p>

            <p>These data points may be used to determine:</p>
            <p>a) What monetization strategy you should execute if one is not already in place</p>
            <p>b) How to optimize your present monetization strategy.</p>

            <p>Some key operation indicators which could direct these conclusions contain general program use, Retention and desertion rates, the number of users that are active, and duration of each session.</p>
            <p>You are in a much better position to understand what monetization strategies might work over others since your application already has a user base and you've been able to collect learnings about user behaviour.</p>

            <h2>Monetization & User Experience</h2>

            <p>Monetization constantly needs to be contemplated in relation to the user experience. An advertising-based program might offer content at no cost, but users go somewhere elsewhere if the promotion interrupts their encounter with program content or is overly intrusive. Likewise, if a user has paid the program for a subscription, they are going to be happy while viewing a video if they see related ads.</p>

            <p>The real challenge is finding the right equilibrium that all optimize sales while additionally offering users the best experience possible, although not only the right strategy.</p>

                      'content' : `<p>Concentrate on 1-2 long tail key words</p>

                      <p>Optimizing your web blog posts for keywords isn't about integrating into your posts as possible as many key words. Turns out that'll really damage your Search Engine Optimization because the search engines will think you are key word stuffing. An excellent guideline is to concentrate on 1 or 2 keywords per blog post. This'll help keep you focused on a target for the post. Keep the focus of the post narrow enough to permit you to spend some time really optimizing for one or two key words while you can use greater than one key word within a post.
                      </p>

                      <p>Contain these 1-2 key words in particular portions of your post</p>
                      <p>Given that you have got your 1 or 2 key words, it is time to integrate them into your blog post. Where are the best portions of your posts to contain these conditions so you rank full of search results? There are four crucial areas where you should strive to contain your key words: URL, headline, headers and body, and meta description. </p>

                      <h2>Title</h2>

                      <p>The title of your site post will be reader's and a search engine's initial step in identifying the relevance of your content, therefore including a key word here's critical. Make certain to include your key word inside the first 65 characters of the title, which can be just about where it is cut by Google away on internet search engine results pages. Technically, Google steps by the pixel width, no count character, and the pixel width lately raised to about 600 pixels, which results in around 65 characters from about 500 pixels for organic search results.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Headers & Body</h2>

                      <p>Mention your key word through the body of the post at a standard cadence and in the headers. Which means including your key words in your copy, but only in a natural, reader friendly manner. Do not go at the danger of being penalized for keyword stuffing. Before you begin writing a blog post that is new, you will likely think on how to assemble integrate your keywords in your post. It should not be your only goal, or even your main focus, although that is a good idea. Whenever you create content, your main focus must be on what issues to your audience, not how often times you may include a keyword or key word phrase because content. Focus on replying whatever question your customer and being helpful could have asked to arrive on your post. Do that, and you will generally find you optimize for key words that are significant, anyhow.</p>

                      <h2>URL</h2>

                      <p>Search engines also look at your URL, to determine what your post is about, and it is among the first things it will crawl on a page. You've got an enormous chance to optimize your URLs on each post you release, on its own distinctive URL as every post resides, so be sure you contain your one to two key words inside. </p>

                      <h2>Meta Description</h2>

                      <p>After in this place, we will dive into describing meta descriptions. Your meta information is intended to give advice about the content of your site post to search engines and readers, so be sure to use your tail term that was long so your audience and Google are clear on the content of your post.</p>

                      <h2>Ensure that your site is Mobile friendly</h2>

                      <p>Since Google disclosed that more individuals use the internet search engine on their mobile than on desktop computer it is been over annually. While cellular friendly sites and reactive design have been significant for user experience, they are becoming increasingly more essential for Search Engine Optimization as well. In case your site uses reactive design, your site pages may only have one URL rather than two ones, for mobile and desktop, respectively. It will help the Search Engine Optimization of your post because any inbound links which come back to your website will not be broken up between the different URLs. </p>

                      <p>Any Search Engine Optimization power you get from all of these links will be central, helping the value of your post is more readily recognized by Google and rank it so.</p>

                      <h2>Optimize the meta description</h2>

                      <p>A meta description is the added text that appears in SERPs that allows readers know exactly what the link is about to review. The meta information provides searchers advice they need to ascertain whether your content is what they are trying to find, and finally helps them decide not or if they will click. Additionally to being reader friendly, your meta information must contain the long tail key word because if we are doing web blogging right, that key word is a representative of the content of the post you're attempting to rank for. By developing reader friendly content with key word inclusion that is natural, you will make it simpler for Google to show the relevancy of your post for you in SERPs. </p>

                      <h2>Do Not use too many similar subject tags</h2>

                      <p>Subject tags might help arrange your site content, but they can in fact be dangerous if you overuse them. If you've way too many comparable tags, search engines may penalized you for having duplicate content. Think about it like that: whenever you create a subject tag, you also create a fresh website page, wherein the content from these subject tags will appear. It subsequently appears in search engines as if you are revealing the content multiple times through your web site if you use a lot of similar tags for the same content.</p>

Organic SEO cannot supply results considerably quicker than PPC.

AdWords gives you the ability to define a wide variety of variants, from keyword match types to places and the precise times it's printed. It's also possible to use advertising extensions, which allow you to choose what's shown – this can contain the product picture or contact details. </p>

                              <p>No one needs to spend some time browsing an internet site that isn’t technically sound.

To your followers to take actions, they need to feel compelled to do so. Participation is actually the measure of how compelling your content is to the crowd that is viewing your posts. Whether you have a participation rate that is poor, it's time to start testing chances for optimizing your social media success. </p>


        <p><b>Tip 3:</b> It can be difficult to decipher what someone actually thinks of you.

Now, the social network lets you achieve a degree of penetration you've never before had. With monitoring this metric, the only problem is the data is voluminous; each person is expressing emotions that are different and different nuances about your brand. It's demanding to keep up. Many brands buy social media listening applications to help them to understand the views customers have on the social media platform of their brands. </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Social media metrics don\'t have to be a puzzle.

However, simply keeping a social network existence isn\'t enough to warrant cash and your time. The social network needs an important amount of planning, money, and ability in order to optimize value. Here are a few suggestions to help you to get started.</p>

            <p>More often than not, customers will maintain that their goals are customer acquisition, increasing net sales, brand awareness, and participation. That’s a lot to carry through for one advertising channel, although social network can have wonderful results. Concentrate on one to two steps in your marketing funnel, and the key is to understand your customer journey. Just as you do that, you can subsequently delegate KPIs and proper metrics that support that stage in the consumer journey.</p>

            <p>The social network is a huge lab of evaluations. You will have some first notion of what works and what does not. This measure should be finished before you craft a social network content strategy.</p>
            <p>A social network strategy that is clever is about targeting the right people with the right messages. That seems much like a good advertising strategy, right? The social network, Instagram and Facebook especially, are basically ad networks. The 2% to 3% you’ll be reaching may have a minimal impact on your business. You have to have a plan to leverage the paid tools that the social networks supply, but before that, you should do some audience profiling. Profile your audience as comprehensively as possible, including demographics, all psychographic, and geographical components.</p>

            <p>What you need to know is which channels are dominant for the audience and concentrate your organization ability on defeating the competition in those areas that are targeted.</p>

Twitter was the first social media site to use hashtags, but now they're used across all social network. There is an assortment of online tools that you may use to locate the greatest hashtags.</p>

              <p>Twitter continues to be among the finest resources for locating amazing hashtags, but don't discount the utility of other tools. </p>

              <h2>WhatTheTrend</h2>
              <p>WhatTheTrend is a veritable wellspring of information and Twitter data. It's possessed by Hootsuite, meaning that the hashtags could be monitored as streams within Hootsuite. It lets you see trends internationally, nationwide, as well as tendencies which are unique to your very own city. It's possible for you to monitor by the month, or by the day. The fundamental service is free, but you can update to paid service if you need more choices.</p>

              <h2>Hashtags.org</h2>
              <p>This venerable service got its start as a freebie in the year 2007, and the fundamental tracking functions are still free — you can see what's been trending over the preceding twenty-four hours. However, if you want to store hashtags and track them over time periods that are longer, you will have to update to the paid service.</p>

              <h2>Trendsmap</h2>
              <p>To be realistic, Trendsmap isn't the most thrilling tool visually with regards to helping you locate the greatest hashtags, however, it does empower you to see hashtags by continent, state or city on a world map. In case your primary focus is local, now this is an incredibly useful, quite practical tool.</p>

              <h2>Using hashtags efficiently</h2>
              <p>It\'s insufficient to simply know how to use hashtags. You have to be sure your hashtags are related to your subject matter. It's also a shrewd idea to base your hashtags on keywords that are popular. Google Keyword Planner is a fantastic resource you may use. Also, you need to be careful about how you structure your hashtags.</p>

              <h2>Quantifying the contest</h2>
              <p>I often head around to Twazzup to see how a specific hashtag is being utilized by people during any time of the day. You sign in with Twitter and after that, input a hashtag or keyword. You get all the newest results scrolling down your screen, as well as how the hashtag is being utilized by influencers.</p>

              <p>This lets you see what kind of contest there'll be to get eyeballs on your hashtagged tweet. Twazzup may also tell you about how frequently times that hashtag is used in one hour. Two things: know if you're using a hashtag that is used 3,000 times per hour.</p>
              <p>It's a hashtag that is popular, and your place will be pushed off the top of recently printed places quite quickly.</p>
              <p>Those two aspects play against one another. You should use a popular hashtag that gets some use, but if it's not overly unpopular, your tweet might get immediately forgotten.</p>
              <p>To discover what to do in situations like these, you'll have to do some testing. It's also possible to develop long-tail keywords and use them with the more popular hashtags.</p>

                              'overview' : 'Technology giants know that their device isn\'t being used by people with applications anymore. Only 35 percent of smartphone users download one application',
                              'content' : `<p>Technology giants know that their device isn\'t being used by people with applications anymore. Only 35 percent of smartphone users download one application within an average month, and the typical application loses 90 percent of its day-to-day users that are active within one month of launch. Consumers need a fresh, on-demand type of program: one clad in a conversational interface, prepared to serve, and able to perform sophisticated activities.</p>

<p>Need to check your flight status, get an Uber for your destination, or book a property? You may have learnt to download and browse multiple applications, or you might type your request to an application using the new virtual helper, Facebook M, and be greeted by a familiar, intuitive software. From a program that 900 million people use, within Facebook Messenger, virtually wide functionality is promised. You have an individual trade record for purchases and prevent toggling among programs by selecting Facebook M. Also, there is no need if you fly with another provider in the future to download a fresh program.</p>

<p>The future of technology is about ease of good use and human action, and this is why Facebook M has a host of rivals. WeChat, Siri, Google Now, Alexa, Duer, and Cortana, only to name a couple, are all vying to become the customer's next favored personal assistant and program home base. </p>

<h2>WeChat: The creator of Facebook M. </h2>
<p>As thrilling as M is, the conversational interface wasn't pioneered by Facebook. It just brought the technology to the Western world. The little known king of conversational UI is a cellular communication program debuted by Chinese web giant Tencent in 2011, now WeChat.</p>

<p>It is those users who get complete access to the conversational, feature-loaded program, although Tencent will not say how many of its 697 million monthly active users are based in mainland China. What is so unique about WeChat? For starters, it is not only for messaging. It uses its own surroundings where users can instruct it to finish a whole host of jobs: they can pay utility bills, share music, book a doctors appointment, order coffee, answer e-mails, and read the news.</p>

<p>Naturally, WeChat is not the closing paradigm in conversational interfaces. The reason for its popularity, and its largest initiation so far, could be its interface. Purchasing pizza via the latest Bot Framework of Microsoft took WeChat merchandise manager Dan Grover and blogger 73 faucets, while the interface of WeChat needed just 16 faucets, six of which were given to inputting a PIN. The conversational software, as WeChat shows, is not replacing programs, it is just enhancing the way they are accessed by us. And as we continue to develop UI technology that is conversational in nature, our programs can be increasingly smarter, more human, and more useful.</p>

<h2>Support Adoption Through UX Progress </h2>
<p>Naturally, the hard work of programmers on conversational AI technology means nothing if folks are not using it. By linking the technology to Messenger traction supported for M. Similar to how a firm made by compelling Facebook users to install the Messenger program for improved functionality Messenger popular, the firm debuted M through in program prompts. In much the same manner, programmers and designers must introduce conversational interfaces with programs that take complete benefit of them. Here is how to assist users to grow used to the new faces of programs through enhanced user experience:</p>

<h2>1. Rely on third-party integrations</h2>
<p>Rather than constructing characteristics from scratch for a brand new program with a UI that is conversational, take benefit of 3rd party integrations. Users do not need to open a dozen programs to make complete use of the merchandise, and 3rd party integrations add an interface and functionality and familiarity. The workplace cooperation platform Slack, for instance, has made its program by incorporating more than 150 3rd party applications into its software, including Dropbox, Twitter, Google, and Uber, even more, user-friendly.</p>
<p>Programs and excellent messaging platforms will be integrators that are great. Winning applications and third-party integrations will match conversational interfaces to easily solve user's needs more proficiently and with a much better experience. Once these interfaces take off, expect customers to utilize them to schedule baby sitter, find flats, indicate more, and recipes.</p>

<h2>2. Use graphical interface to support conversational UI</h2>
<p>Conversational programs are thrilling because everyone dreams of having a personal assistant. But to make conversational UIs really user-friendly, these messaging platforms should understand the limits of text-based interaction. It is because text dialogues alone can't make input signal natural and powerful.</p>
<p>Let us say you are buying concert tickets. You need to sit close to the stage, but not too close. And, obviously, before selecting your tickets you need to see the cost. Hours could be spent by a conversational bot offering prices for each, describing relative distances from the stage, and listing accessible seats. But would it not make more sense for the conversational program to start the interactive seat map of the ticketing firm? An individual could quickly peek at check costs and the alternatives before purchasing tickets. Programmers of spontaneous conversational interfaces will, maybe most significantly, need to understand when dialogue isn't the best method to solve an issue. In these scenarios, conversational programs could use a little widget in the chat window to give the choice of a 3rd party graphical interface to the user. Chat interfaces are a much better means to get services and the advice you need, making it considerably more easy than thumbing through folders and pages to locate the right program. For specialized folks, picture it like a command-line interface that is smart and intuitive.</p>

<h2>3. Make AI situationally sensitive</h2>
<p>Nowadays, conversational bots excel in all jobs like defining terms or making bookings. However, the trick is to perform jobs in a way that will require knowledge of interests and each user's intentions. The Quartz program, for example, proactively sends GIFs, messages, pictures, and links related to users with current events. Each report offers two scripted answers: a cheeky answer in emojis or several words or the choice to bypass the current news story. But to gain popularity among users, programs with conversational interfaces may have to offer answers using emojis, or they will need to mimic human interaction by asking questions and actively contributing to the dialogue.</p>
<p>What this means is that UX developers will need to work with AI programmers to ensure the reply content and tone are suitable for each dialog. A chatbot program making bookings for a comedy club, for example, should be positive and crack jokes. Still, that conduct probably would not go over well with a user who's utilizing the program to make funeral arrangements or to contract legal services. Then it ought to know how to request it suitably if the bot needs more info to perform a job.</p>

<h2>The Future of Conversational Chat Bots.</h2>
<p>Smart applications clad in chat interface will shortly be competent to interpret jobs like a human might. Within a decade, we will be capable of holding intelligent conversations with various chatbots, nearly like immediate specialists, via our smart devices. Chatbots will be almost as prevalent as programs are now, and those that increase to the top may be the bots with the most spontaneous and useful interfaces. We are not far from the future where we will ask our automobiles to buy eggs and milk before picking us up from work and after that, once home, open the blinds, turn on the television, and pre-heat the oven with only a few words. In the meantime, we will ponder issues related to finance, sports, or medication with bot specialists. An unusually linked future is arriving: All you have to do is ask for it.</p>

                                'overview' : 'Consumers are a demanding bunch. Personalized online services are increasingly insisted on by them, but they hate sacrificing their privacy to get it.',
                                'content' : `<p>Consumers are a demanding bunch. Personalized online services are increasingly insisted on by them, but they hate sacrificing their privacy to get it. The main anxiety driving this hesitation? A lack of control of how and with whom their info is shared. Many people have tolerated that their increased reliance on the net means losing privacy. More individuals are not assured that on-line advertisers, search engines, video platform, and social media sites will keep their private data and tasks safe.</p>

<p>Luckily, personalization and privacy can go together. By creating their user encounters around enhanced protection, businesses can provide systems that feel straightforward and customized while preserving security and privacy.</p>

<h2>Going on the security offensive</h2>

<p>Till the past several years, the data security sector continues to be reactive. Businesses relied on network firewalls to shield very sensitive information. Every month or two, a violation would happen someplace. Other corporations offering security infrastructures and Microsoft would release a patch, and they would be implemented by companies in the hopes the patches will keep. Even fundamental attacks cost businesses about $7 million and allow hackers to steal data that is precious.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, just patching these holes is a losing game. The Internet of Things is introducing more security threats daily. A couple of years back, most folks used three or two devices to connect to the net. Now, it is not only their telephones but notebooks and tablets as well, which can be wired. Common appliances in houses and office spaces are connected to the internet as well. The widespread access to the Internet comes along with lots of dangers, most of which centre on abuses of advice and shielding data.</p>

<p>The ecosystem of the web is quite different now from even ten years ago. It is time that the data sector reacted to this proactively.</p>

<h2>Solving the privacy vs personalization conundrum</h2>

<p>Digital literacy is on the increase, which will be great news for privacy worries. Folks are thinking about their privacy requirements and what considerations they are willing to do when they start using popular applications.</p>

<p>WhatsApp, Snapchat and Facebook are a pleasure, but people wonder whether it is worth giving up their solitude to participate in the social network. As the public becomes more and more knowledgeable about data security, businesses will start to offer alternatives that balance privacy and functionality that is personalized to prevent losing customers. For one, we stress the concept of data privacy, which suggests embedding seclusion standards into design specifications. The notion applies to technology; however, it works in physical infrastructures and company practices as well. Secrecy direction is composed into the DNA as opposed to responding after violations happen. Individuals feel far much more comfortable giving their information out when they get to control when and who sees it, as opposed to when a corporation determines the rules, in a way overly complicated for them to understand. Comprehending circumstance in secrecy management is crucial.</p>

<p>UX design that places control in users hands should appease consumers concerns about how their information is used. The proactive focus on strengthening security in the structure also helps guard against information violations, which will be increasingly significant as individuals share more of their lives online.</p>

<p>Privacy centric user experiences aren't without their challenges. Before we see prevalent breakthroughs, technologists and research workers must defeat several hurdles, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Siloed research: Many people that work on data privacy may focus just on cloud security, but they do not speak to interface designers. There is no communication between the creatives and the scientists. The future of information protection depends on multidisciplinary teams that may create security layouts and well rounded UX. For example, Google now enables Gmail to use the data in customers e-mails to show them related content and products and to comprehend their designs. This system might be enhanced to work similarly to a real-life helper.

<p>Users might turn the machine learning service on and off when they are hunting for something particular as needed. They might feel more in control if those algorithms could be turned off by them at any moment, as opposed to having their private messages always accessible by Google. Improved security relies on individuals having more control over what they share in professional and private settings. However, it requires a multifaceted team to identify and implement such alternatives.</p></li>

<li>Generational preferences: Millennials are more trusting than older generations with regards to revealing their information online. A 2014 Mintel study revealed that 6 in 10 millennials would give private info in exchange for some bonus or increased client experience. Solitude problems need a lot more than a one size fits all strategy. Designers should realize the context in which users communicate with their sites. Their readiness to share their tips can substantially influence, so design and contextual privacy policies are required to meet consumers needs that are changing.</li>

<li>Sophistication: Computer scientists and data research workers are not the only ones that need to be in on design dialogues; programmers and attorneys must be in the combination as well because secrecy and security are complex areas. Simplified policies would enable designers to train users through straightforward, intuitive interfaces.</li></ol>

<p>Great practices are emerging around tiered info launch systems that keep company info more protected by disseminating advice only when needed. Privacy centered layouts empower users to control their information. This enhances security across the board and creates a greater sense of trust. Corporations releasing patches in response to violations isn't a long term option.</p>

                                  'content' : `<p>It is frustrating to locate job offers seeking a UI/UX designer. A UI designer might not comprehend user experience psychology. But there\'s a great amount of overlap, and also to be an excellent UI/UX designer you will need to drop a toe in both worlds. Recall that the user is spoken for by a UI/UX designer. Find out the users likes and dislikes. Attempt to locate the cause of their problems and only make the changes that are required. Every good UX designer will be an actual supporter of the user. The user experience goes beyond a slick interface to encompass how a UI acts, feels, and reacts to user interaction.</p>

<p>Pay cautious attention to the details and be willing to fight thoughts even when you think they are amazing. Listen to the user's criticisms and attempt to comprehend what they are actually saying. This can be true of both UI and UX designers, although most user testing includes the UX side of things. Possibly the most useful ability of any designer is visual communication. The ability to sketch is an excellent ability to have to be able to clarify your thoughts. By creating interactive models, mockups, or digital wireframes, you also can convey ideas digitally.</p>

<p>It is essential to convey your ideas visually to the development team & the design team. Be capable of communicating with advertising and company employees also. Use layman's terms to describe more complex characteristics. Describe what the UX plan is to everybody using words or whatever visuals required. One part of this is to master a visual medium. Another part of this is communication. Just because an idea makes sense to you, it does not mean it make sense to others as well. Ask customers and your team if they need clarification on something.</p>

<p>Not all UX developers know how to use Sketch, Photoshop, or Illustrator. But every UI designer must know a minimum of one of those applications. Visuals must be created by UI designers, whether interface mockups, icons, or symbols. UX designers are more concerned with how users achieve their goals and how these interfaces act. An excellent UI/UX designer must be thinking about every measure of the design procedure. The procedure begins with prototyping and wireframing and subsequently moves into total action through digital graphical/UI design. Animation software enables you to model actions without really constructing a demonstration software with code. Job leaders like to see most of these assets, and your abilities will prove invaluable to the procedure.</p>

<p>If you can empathize with users, you will be capable of comprehending their worries, their battles, and their criticisms with an interface. The greatest UX developers consider the target market for any specified job. Think about your market to comprehend and consider what they want. Interpret the individual issues of every job by understanding how the target audience thinks & takes action.</p>

<p>A user will have complains for sure if they face any hurdles during the testing. A UX Designer comes up with solutions through collecting feedback and analyzing what needs to be done in terms of improving it.</p>

This not only involves complete user interaction with the software but even a soothing mindset of users when they have a peek at your program. Programmers or pro-mobile app designers regularly assess the demand of the program and effort to craft value inside the UX to provide users with what they desire.</p>

  <h2>Parts giving rise to a whole UX</h2>

  <p>You may wonder about what parameters to contemplate while building a successful user experience. Let's take a look at these UX components: </p>

  <ul><li>Pleasant information architecture design to supply information methodically through navigational topics. </li>
  <li>Accessibility attributes to enable disabled people competent to use the program easily without much hustle.</li>
  <li>Human-computer interaction to understand the degree of interaction occurring between the two from one medium to another.</li>
  <li>Ergonomic design must be such that programs might be refined and optimized efficiently for attractiveness. It should contain a variety of sub-elements like weight, height, temperature, vision, hearing, advice percentage, and more. It covers desk measurements and computer seats as well.</li>
  <li>Utility tools improve the OS by adding capacities up to make the best use of the system procedures. They could be non-fundamental parts of the system, but do add functionalities when not supplied initially. Program operation refers to the speed of the program where it operates, using up minimal loading time when changing between displays and letting users have high-speed access to the interface.</li>
   </ul>
  <h2>Suggestions when using the UX parts strategically</h2>

  <p>There has to be a steady shift in the methods used for re-formulating and changing the UX. Preferences and user behaviour changes with time, and so do their functionality anticipations. Businesses frequently confront this hurdle of their workers having knowledge of programs that are developing, but neglect to provide an unmatchable user experience. The organizations need to successfully communicate the type of user experience they expect to deliver to their users, even if they outsource. In several other instances, the company that is outsourced isn't able to comprehend what value is expected from the UX they design for the customer company.</p>

  <h2>Do not use complicated words</h2>
  <p>A language barrier can prove to be a significant hurdle, especially when dealing with various types of users. Also, making use of incredibly specialized words like heuristic evaluation, journey maps, mood boards, wire frames, parts, and more, will not only confuse users but will frustrate them so much that they may need to switch off the program. </p>

  <h2>Share a compatible belief with the users</h2>
  <p>Since a designer is involved with creating an application user experience, it just does not mean to integrate things as per their will. The UX of an application should be designed keeping yourself in the shoes of the user. Understand their expectations and interests. Empathize with them to let your program connect with users on all levels.</p>

  <p>It is best to ask them directly what they anticipate out of your program and to reach out to your end-users. You have integrated a lot of attributes, but your application may still lack many attributes that you are oblivious of. You must get acquainted with new features that could prove to improve your program if implemented. However, when unifying usability with the look, ensure neither is undermined.</p>

  <h2>Do not deliver something which users are not able to digest</h2>
  <p>Many times, programmers attempt to incorporate attributes with a surprise component that users may not have anticipated in the first place. Such elements are directed towards bringing an element of shock to impress users. Some users are not able to digest such offerings, and hence they have a contradicting effect. Such characteristics create an unpleasant environment, with unsatisfied users who walk away and may never try to open your program again.</p>

  <h2>User Experience is an easy method to gain the hearts of program users</h2>

  <p>We only discussed tricks and the UX components to improve your program \with respect to a user mindset. Executing them within your program will not only establish your credibility inside the smartphone applications circuit but will provides your applications a distinctive place in the hearts of users.</p>

UX designers must be capable of comprehending the language of company penetrations and fuse it with user needs to create encounters that are amazing.</p>

    <h2>Align UX Design Strategy With Your Business Goals</h2>

    <p>User Experience is not just a set of methodologies and techniques about design for customers, but tactical thinking about expectation, want, and customer behaviours.

User experience establishes the basis of a business's customer strategy to reach a differentiating degree against opponents.</p>

    <p>However, it is to be aligned with long-term, and brief company aims to create a cohesive user experience across all possible touchpoints and merchandises and get results that are quantifiable.

For UX teams, it is critical to collaborate from the early stages of the design jobs with a few other sections. This functions to perceive the strategies behind placing and improving products or services with time while investigating the consequences and interdependencies between brand- encounter and distinguished value.</p>

    <h2>Develop Situational Awareness</h2>

                                        'img':'assets/images/blogs/b2b-and-b2c-designing.jpg',
                                        'title':'B2B and B2C Designing',
                                        'overview' : 'Both B2B and B2C sites need to offer details about the products or services, need a design that is aesthetically pleasing, and need to be clear and concise. ',
                                        'content' : `<p>Both B2B and B2C sites need to offer details about the products or services, need a design that is aesthetically pleasing, and need to be clear and concise. On the other hand, the demands of a company and a consumer have a tendency to differ. Therefore, the quantity of the UX, detail, and design demands are inconsistent between B2C and B2B sites.</p>

      <p>Here are a few of the most important variables that you must look closely at when designing a consumer versus a company web site.</p>

      <h2>Purchase procedure</h2>
      <p>A business-to-consumer purchase procedure is considerably more straightforward. Consumers look for a suitable, simple purchasing procedure. Users don't need to have to register to purchase something. Rather, they would choose to place their info in and click purchase. Consumers have several choices when it comes to where to buy something, so the merchandise on your web site must stand out from the competition.</p>

      <p>A company-to business purchase procedure is consistently a lot less straightforward than B2C. It has multiple phases, like filling out a form, private interactions, assessment of proposals, approvals, etc. Most businesses have a special set of guidelines and protocols that must be followed. As a B2B company, we see this all of the time. As much info as possible is required for another company to buy from us to pass on to others. Unlike business-to-consumer, you should always expect to have some kind of interaction that is private in the procedure until the final purchase is made.</p>

      <h2>Emotional variables</h2>
      <p>Business-to-consumer purchases are typically linked with emotions. Psychological causes frequently direct a customer to make a purchase. It's the feeling that the merchandise or service provides to the customer which leads them to complete a purchase. Branding is an enormous variable in driving emotions, considerably more so in the company-to consumer world, than in business-to-business sales. Business-to-business purchases can be psychological, but in a different way. Individuals are more scared to make a choice, since it may change their whole team or business. Anxiety and risk aversion are two emotions which might be usually linked with business-to-business purchases.</p>

      <h2>Pricing models</h2>
      <p>Business-to-consumer pricing is upfront, transparent, and quite clear-cut. Unless someone has a discount code, prices don't differ from consumer to consumer. Services or upselling and cross-selling products is also another common thing among B2C sites, which will be extremely important to look closely at. </p>Business-to-business pricing isn't as clear-cut as business-to-consumer, as it may differ from one company to another depending upon the needs of the customer. A business-to-business web site generally doesn't list prices connected with the service or the product.</p>

      <p>Generally, B2B sites have various choices for various sorts of businesses and different strategies, catering for a sizeable array of sectors and sizes.</p>

      <h2>Buyer decision making</h2>

      <p>When coping with a B2C website, your website is only socializing with one man: the buyer/decision-maker. The decision-maker does not need anyone to get permission to make that determination, or to vindicate their conclusion.</p>

      <p>When a user is on a business-to-business website, the multiple individuals involved sometimes have to follow some processes, leading to a complicated and lengthy decision making procedure. Business to business customers will start their research months before making a purchase.</p>

      <p>Typically, business-to-business services and products are priced higher than something recorded on a business-to-consumer website. Since things are likely to be more pricey on a business-to-business website, decision-makers need to make sure the merchandise or the service will fit in the workflow and the present system.</p>

      <h2>Business-to-consumer web design</h2>

      <p>When designing a business-to-consumer website, you need to make sure the content strategy is at a certain level. The website will want powerful and catchy headlines. Short yet appealing to the consumer. You do not need to overload the web site with content since the customer is not seeking for a ton of information.</p>
      <p>Since a consumer can purchase similar merchandise on an alternative website, your design is noticeable among the competition and must be identifying. The user and usability experience should consistently be updated, offering the easiest checkout procedure possible.</p>
      <p>Merchandise/ service information must be clear, and upfront or no consumer will need to make a purchase. Remember that most consumers will make their purchase in their first few visits, so the first impression is as vital as ever.</p>

      <h2>Business-to-business web design</h2>

      <p>Users on business-to-business web sites are hunting for as much information as possible. Before converting, your user has to trust the website totally. In case your website looks trustable and does not have useful information, your conversion rates will stay low.</p>
      <p>Having a different design is less significant with regards to a business-to-business website. Your plan should be more centered around information and the content. Content strategy on a business-to-business web site also needs to contain numerous types of content: explainer videos, reviews, podcasts, websites, FAQs, whitepapers, webinars, and recorded merchandise demos. Having multiple versions of information will actually help the user understand the issue that you are solving.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>Business-to-business and business-to-consumer web sites have audiences that are distinct, with unique needs.</p>
      <p>When designing for a business-to-business website, an extended, complicated buying cycle must be supported by you with as much information as possible. On the other hand, your business-to-consumer web site must have UX, top-grade visual design and usability.</p>
      <p>While these things are significant on every website, there should be more focus on them on a business-to-consumer website. Eventually, whenever you can convey costs and prices as definitely as possible.</p>

                                          'title':'The Art of Mobile Design',
                                          'overview' : 'The greatest mobile products feel so simple that it appears as if anyone could make them. Clearly, nothing might be further from the truth.',
                                          'content' : `<p>The greatest mobile products feel so simple that it appears as if anyone could make them. Clearly, nothing might be further from the truth. It can take a lot of effort to make something wonderful. Enlarging and focusing are two primary kinds of design components that designers use to create beauty on mobile.</p>

        <p>Businesses have five kinds of focusing design components at their disposal:</p>

        <ul><li><h2>Onboarding </h2>

        <p>Design components that are onboarding plan to provide a user value before they even sign up. Consider a scenario where you met someone interesting and intriguing. Did you immediately ask them private information like their age or e-mail address? Probably not. It's the same on mobile. Before anyone starts using merchandise that is mobile, they need to know it will be worth their while. They'd like to understand how and what it will do for them. Optimizing program store descriptions, advertising copy, screenshots, video tutorials, by focusing on value first, before requesting people to share private information to invest is crucial.
        Their expectations are set when they decide to become a user after they have been convinced by the onboarding design components that their needs will be matched or surpassed. That is not where multiple -job design components come into play.</p></li>

        <li><h2>Single-job</h2>

        <p>Single-job design components keep a user focused on what they actually need to see through. Reflect on one's own interactions with others for a minute. What do you do to communicate that you are paying attention? When do you know they're not? So how exactly does that make you feel? Our behaviour is mimicked by mobile products. When they offer alternatives that are unimportant or have way too much of variety, they cause confusion, reluctance, and we cease using them. The easier it is for a user to finish a job, the more likely they are to return and because of this the more comfortable they become with the program. It's difficult to get rid of things which make our lives simpler. On the other hand, mobile products that are excellent need to enable users to navigate from one job to the next effortlessly. That's the job navigation design components duty.</p></li>

        <li><h2>Navigation</h2>

        <p>Navigation design components are often concealed to make room for the single-job design components to take center stage. Often with regards to navigation, less is more. In some uncommon instances, it's essential to have multiple degrees of navigation. Designers often spend an excellent deal of time developing navigation elements because they drive how efficient a user will judge their merchandise to be. Reviews saying that something is difficult to use generally comes from navigation that is badly constructed. Worse than difficult to use are reviews complaining about crashes along with other malfunctions. </p>
         </li>
        <li><h2>Efficiency</h2>

        <p>When people find they've invested time in an item that doesn't work, they believe that their time is not being valued. Plus they cease using the merchandise and vent their frustrations.</p>
        <p>Because they presume that mobile works like internet, teams which are new to mobile will often underestimate the need for efficient design components. In case it breaks, it may be repaired within a few hours with a so-called patch. This is the case on mobile: program store acceptances may take weeks, or even months due to the constraints of the ecosystem, like by repairing something broken.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h2>Gesture</h2>

        <p>On infrequent occasions, advanced gestures can not be untroubled. Double-tap on an image in Instagram or swipe right on Tinder to express interest.
        However, we have come to expect something quite special out of simple mobile gestures. One tap is like pressing on a button, two taps are for zooming, it is deleted by a right swipe on an item, etc.</p></li></ul>

        <h2>Design components that are enlarging are about the circumstance</h2>
        <p>Onboarding, single- efficacy, navigation, job, or gesture concentrating design components are assumed to be efficient. They establish predictable and straightforward rules of communication. Trust is built by them. Users start to anticipate more as trust builds. This needs access to private information, which will be where design components that are enlarging come in. They come in two kinds:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h2>Pull</h2>

        <p>Design components that are pull grant permission to access users' data that is private, like the place, images, or a contact. Designers want to be quite transparent about when and why they want it, because of how private that information is. Context is crucial. Getting permission to obtain a user's private data is a huge step, and getting the green light to send them so called push tellings is an even larger one.</p>
         </li>
        <li><h2>Push</h2>

        <p>Shove notifications keep a design so simple that users no further have to use the merchandise itself when done right.
        Get Facebook: The push reminds individuals of their pals birthday, helping everybody recall to celebrate. At the top of this, users no more have to open when their buddies' birthdays are on the Facebook mobile program.</p></li></ul>

Content, however great it is, needs to be presented in ways that can engage and involve your audience.

<h2>Create interactive content</h2>

<p>Now, content can't exist from its audience and its writer. If you've other writers contributing to the cause, or if you're the only originator of all of the content on your web site, get them to participate with the audience on a daily basis. Whether it is through newsgroups, discussions, or by replying to opinions and user comments, it does not matter. You have to create a two way street between your readers and you. Excellent design will empower you to do that, but it's the content that'll be the driver.</p>

<h2>Figure your market out</h2>

<p>In order to create useful and more important content, you have to think about who the reader is before you begin writing. What do they enjoy, what do they dislike, how old they're, where do they reside, what kind of issues do they have, what do they do for a living, and so forth. All of these are things that may direct your content formation procedure, and you have to think of ahead. However pleased you're with your content, it's your crowd that may be reading it. They need to enjoy it as well.</p>

<h2>Use the appropriate tone</h2>

<p>Tons of content creators make the error of using flamboyant terms and business jargon so as to show off as it pertains to the tone of the content. What they do not get is that only preserves their crowd at a space. The trick is to utilize conversational tone and simple language in order to get across your point. Do not behave more intelligent than your crowd, and do not slow it down for them either.</p>

<h2>People react differently</h2>

<p>You have no means of understanding what will be clicked next by your reader whereas books are read cover to cover. Also, they don't really read the content. They simply scan it until some information grabs their attention. What this means is you need to present all the facts that are essential right away, particularly with regards to your home page. Get their attention with content that is broken up into concise and brief paragraphs, with subheadings which certainly exemplify what the paragraph contains in a few words. Once they are hooked, you can direct them to your site section, where you will be able to present more in-depth content to them.</p>

<h2>Bring the content to the individuals</h2>

<p>Offering content through your website is not enough. Folks spend an excellent amount of time on the social network, which implies you will need to be there, as well. Now, remember that you don't have to be present on every social media, but you do have to cover LinkedIn, or the most well-known ones, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest. Additionally, bear in mind that your design and your content need to be optimized for mobile devices today. So using brief paragraphs of text, high-resolution pictures, and lots of white space is a must.</p>

<h2>Concentrate on your market</h2>

<p>You need SEO to make your web site visible to search engines, but try and do it with the consumer at heart. Don't do it just because it makes your content look good with keywords and phrases. Be sure your texts, while optimized, supply an easy reading encounter that will entice readers to stay on your web site a little bit longer.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As you can tell, your content and your design are inextricably linked, because collectively they create a distinctive user experience for the readers. Which means that they need to be created at heart with one another, and they depend on one another. But most significant of all, you should craft both to catch the attention of your audience, supplying all the details they want in the smoothest manner possible to them.</p>

                                    'content' : `<p>User-focused design is a methodology; a comprehensive framework of procedures where the focus is set on the users. It encompasses not only the design of the UI, but tasks that are also like user research. The aim is to create a product that is designed as per the needs, desires and constraints of the users, as opposed to driving them to conform to it.</p>
  <p>A CRO strategy that considers these actions is urged and signifies the optimal solution. But critical developments may also be reached by directly changing the UI according to the principles of user-focused design.</p>

  <h2>Remove Barriers</h2>
  <p>UX problems can cause problems with it comes to conversion. They often belong to these groups: lack of user fatigue, uncertainties, and feedback. The general aim is to minimize the cognitive load – in order to use an internet site the number of mental effort demanded by the UI.</p>
  Let\'s take a look at some problems that are common and how to get rid of them to clear the path to conversion.</p>

  <h2>Visual Mess</h2>
  <p>UI components which are not helping users reach their aims (and your business targets) are harmful. They are a way to obtain distraction and need additional attempt to distinguish them from the components that are helpful.</p>
  Show only the information that is needed in any specific scenario. Prevent colours, pictures, layouts or links that don't add value. Leave adequate white space between components.</p>

  <h2>Measures</h2>
  <p>The trail to conversion is made up of a chain of measures. An option that is good needs a minimal number of measures. A better option needs a brief number of easy measures. Embrace alternatives that reduce the mental exertion of the whole procedure, as opposed to raising the mental attempt to reduce the number of measures.</p>

  <h2>Content</h2>
  <p>Use minimal amount of text needed to share your message. Allow it to be simple to read by having adequately sized font, text lines that are short, brief paragraphs and sentences, and short segments with enough white space in between. Create a dialogue with your users and answer their questions. Graphs, illustrations and pictures are often an efficient means to communicate a message clearer and quicker.</p>

  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>Because they are uncertain of what\'ll occur next in case the anchor text is not clear, users might want a link. Compose significant links that suggest what the user will get or will see.</p>

  <h2>Forms</h2>
  <p>Forms are essential. Only inquire what you actually want as user exhaustion increases and negatively influences conversion rates. Group associated information in sets. In a multi-measure form, clearly label each measure to give the user insight about the whole procedure from the start. Also, in drop-down menus, the answer choices should cover all the chances rather than compel an answer.</p>


  <h2>Live Chat</h2>
  <p>Sometimes users have doubts or need immediate help while performing a job on your website (e.g. filling in a form). If they can't find an answer, they will leave. Live chat support conserves conversions, prevents users from enabling you to find pain points for additional development, and sharing negative reviews.</p>

  <h2>Touch</h2>
  <p>Mobiles traditionally have problems with low conversion rates. Remember that every device has different use patterns. The key is to consistently simplify when designing for mobiles. Reduce the quantity of text and add even more white space around components on the UI.</p>

  <h2>Visual Layout</h2>
  <p>Your visual design is the first impression your website will make, and it has a huge influence on whether its credibility will be trusted by users. Users are more inclined to give the edge of the uncertainty to a program that is appealing and spend more time on it. Visual signals may be used to prioritize jobs and draw the eye to the functionality that was correct.</p>
  <p>Spend money on great, professional photography and illustrations, be smart with your colour palette and typography.</p>

  <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
  <p>A value proposition is a statement of how merchandise or your service may help your users. Make your value proposition certain, clear, and observable. Assure users that you will deliver on your promise and that they're on the right website.</p>

  <h2>CTA</h2>
  <p>The design of a call-to-action button has a large influence on its effectiveness. Your target is to prevent uncertainties in users head and reduce friction. Make it look like a clickable button and give it a colour and size that highlights it. Create white space around it. CTA buttons are for activity. The text should not be too long and must start with a verb. Ensure that the CTA is unique, but still meets with the complete design of your website. Ensure that it remains straightforward. Prevent selection overload and give priority. In case there is an assortment of activities you want to direct your users to, assign precedence. Allow it to be clear which one is the most critical in accordance with your business targets.</p>

                                      'content' : `<p>Many people skip out on making redesigns simply because they misunderstand what it actually requires. To help you gain an improved understanding on whether an overhaul will assist you or not, here are the most elementary elements on your web site which will be influenced the moment the smallest redesign occurs:</p>

    <p><b>User Interface:</b> The colours you use, the appearance of the components on each page, the alignment of all of it, along with other comparable design aspects, means that you are looking at UI. A/B testing can be conducted easily to see what your audience likes best before the final design is decided.</p>

    <p><b>User Experience:</b> The overall user experience of your website is determined by how easy it's for individuals to find info on your pages. And the moment your UX fails, so does anything else.</p>

    <p>Whenever you consider a redesign on your web site, your conversions may be one among the biggest things which get affected. In case your previous call to action simply wasn't working, but the new one guarantees to do so, then expect your conversion to start growing as well. Obviously, you probably know how important those elements are in achieving success on your site.</p>

    <p>So how frequently should you redesign? You need numerous reasons before you begin redesigning your website. It is something you do when the site is not bringing in the conversions you originally wanted, or is failing to meet the goals that you originally set for it.</p>
    So how frequently do you need to redesign? The answer is as frequently as you need to. </p>

    <p>When should you redesign your website? You should redesign when you're not getting the results you want. You can have a distinctive and creative web site with regards to the overall design, but are you getting the numbers you originally aimed for? Sure, these numbers will not be coming for the first few days or weeks. But if a few months have passed and you still are not attracting the consumer base you have been hoping to reel in, then there is a problem. The moment you believe that it is taking too much time for you to get outcomes, consider redesigning your web site right away.</p>

    <p>Here are some things which could be affecting your site's success: </p>
    <ul><li>You have a weak call to action or your pages concentrate more on design, but it has little to say with regards to the content. </li>
    <li>The pages are text-heavy, or the overall look and feel of your site don't match who you're as a brand.</li></ul>

    <p>Analyze these points and contemplate what other weaknesses your web site could have. Once you identify these weaknesses, revamp your pages immediately and do everything you can to fix these issues so that you could see better numbers and better results from there. Goals and marketing methods can change. Obviously, your web site should be patterned according to both of these factors, therefore the moment they change, it only follows that the web site should be overhauled as well.</p>

    <p>When individuals leave the moment they land, this is an apparent cry for help. In the end, individuals will always trust their senses. Even whether you have a blog full of relevant content in that web site, if the audience doesn't see it, do you think they'd stick around and dig deeper? In case you have an amazing array of products, but were not able to promote those on your homepage, do you think these individuals would even make an effort to go to one page after another only to find them?</p>

    <p>Here are some possible scenarios which might be pushing people away from your web site the moment they land: </p>
    <ul><li>It is difficult to find even the most elementary things on your web site, like contact details. </li>
    <li>It is hard for individuals to navigate your website. </li>
    <li>The info you provide is outdated. </li></ul>

    <p>These are only some of the possibilities, of course. From here, work on a redesign that will deliver what you have been missing out on.</p>

    <p>Third-party tools can let your audiences to shop directly from your own web site, or go to all of your social network profiles. But there'll be newer and better tools emerging, and newer trends you might wish to work with. With the increased use within mobiles along with other gadgets to browse and surf the web, the requirement for a receptive web site shouldn't be underestimated. When individuals understand that your site isn't mobile-friendly at all, they'll just look for an alternative web site which will make changes according to their needs instead of the other way round.</p>

In this blog, we give you suggestions that can help you avoid making some errors that designers usually make: Visitors who can't comprehend what your website is about within several seconds of arriving on your website will leave. Websites with a lot of pictures, text, along with other information going on will take some time to load, plus they'll confuse your visitors. Your visitors need to know what your business is going to do for them and who you are.</p>

      <p>The website that is lost is one which comes with a broad variety of subjects, pictures, colour palettes, and typefaces, not one of which connect. This happens for several reasons. It may occur once you don't have an excellent thought of your brand image. It could likewise occur that you're trying to share way too many thoughts at the same time. Your CTA is the portal to your business. It demands your visitors to do something. Certainly, it's quite crucial that the CTA tells visitors what they actually need to do. There ought to be sufficient information for customers to know just what they're going to get and what information they want to supply. Make sure you have a concise CTA that tells customers just what to do. </p>

      <p>Content is a vital part of an advertising campaign and your website. The content talks about the services or products you offer as well as what tells readers about your firm. Remember to focus on the fonts you select and how content is laid out on the page. Break text up wherever possible, and use visual elements to symbolize theories. Images and pictures are also an essential part of web site design. Pictures that aren't of the top quality will muck up your website and turn visitors off. Likewise, unrelated pictures will only confuse your readers, which makes them question what you're trying to share.</p>

      <p>You've probably spent hours figuring out how to attract consumer interest and creating customer profiles. That is just as important in web site design. Sometimes, an internet site attempts to speak to way too many audiences. In the event that you attempt to please too many types of customers, you'll end up with a website that is muddled. Identify and profile your market and cater to it. If a visitor has to search during your website for contact information, he or she will probably get frustrated and leave.</p>
