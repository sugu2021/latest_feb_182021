      'overview' : 'Email marketing is a viable and relevant marketing tool for businesses ',
      'content' : `<p>Remarketing converts potential clients into customers. Statistics indicate that a remarketing ad is 76% more likely to be viewed than a regular display ad. While people want to make ads relatable to various audiences, they may come across as being either generic, or cliched. However, remarketing ads are more specific and creative as they aim to convert viewers who did not choose your product in the first instance. Hence, the strategy behind the design is significantly different for a remarketing ad. Here are five ways in which you can make the most of using remarketing ads and expand your customer base:
 
      </p>
      <p><b>Use all marketing platforms </b></p> 
      <p>Similar to initial marketing, remarketing must also be creatively delivered using various platforms like Google, YouTube, etc. Using multiple forums will enable you to create a successful campaign directed at the people who have expressed interest but did not complete signing up as your customer. It also enables the delivery of specific content such as promotions, which motivates people to click on your landing page. You can send emails if the potential customer has shared his/her/their email id with you.
      </p>
      <p><b>Show the viewers what they like</b></p>
      <p>Use internet cookies effectively to ensure that you show the potential client how your firm’s product matches the viewer’s personality and tastes. For example, displaying a range of gadgets that the person is interested in increases the chance of the customer opting for your e-commerce site. This way, you can motivate successful conversions by customizing your remarketing endeavor according to the viewer’s needs. To address the people who abandoned your site in the process of purchasing your product, use a call to action and inform them that they have stopped the transaction process at the cart stage. 
      </p>  
      
      <p><b>Use coupons and deals</b></p>
      
       
      <p>The second strategy to get people to sign up through remarketing involves providing them with attractive deals and offers. This is most prominent in the case FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), in which, a 24-hour sale will push the viewer to make the plunge and become your customer. Similarly, distributing coupons and offering engaging deals will bag your customers, as today’s e-commerce is dominated by comparative shopping. Hence, hosting attractive offers will ensure that you stay on the top of the ladder and also make sure that you do not lose your potential customers to external competition.

      </p>

      <p><b>Complement their products</b>
      </p>
      <p>While understanding remarketing, you must remember that your existing customers could change allegiance at any point. Hence, remarketing is a continuous process in which you continue to provide services that interest and benefit your existing customers. This can be done by showing complementary products; for example, if the customer purchases a mobile phone on your site, it is unlikely that he or she will purchase another phone in the near future. However, you can use this opportunity to sell them complementary products like phone covers and protection glass, which they might require for their phones. 
      </p>

      <p>Remarketing is a constant process of digital marketing, which is sure to not only bring in more customers but also maintain healthy relations with existing customers as well. </p>

      <p >It’s story - the narrative that is unique to it. 
      </p>

      <p><b>But we are not the regular Story tellers of your Brand.</b></p>
 
      <p>You heard it right. At BrandStory we do not get carried away with the idea of just stories. Implementation and the aftermath (literally the after-math i.e Analytics) matters a lot here.
      </p>

      <p>BrandStory is a creative agency that recreates a brand by identifying its story and crafting a suitable narrative. In today’s day and age, where established brands have a plethora of brick-and-mortar stores as well as a dominant online presence, other brands also need coherent branding and narrative building initiatives to exhibit the different sides of their personas. There are intriguing stories to be discussed at every touchpoint and we’re here to articulate these narratives!</p>

      <p><b>What makes us the storytellers that we are?</b></p>     
      
      <p>Storytelling is an art designed to appear at the right time in the right place. The right story hits home! To ensure every story has an impact on its intended audience, our framework is simple. We first determine our larger potential, the different services that we shall look into for considering all the varied places a user connects with a brand. Our partners and collaborators, who are from diverse creative and business backgrounds, help us create compelling stories and take business-driven decisions for the brand. From brand strategists to visual artists, we love to confer a unique character to companies, people, or ideas. At BrandStory, we have come together due to our passion for stories and how they are intertwined with brands.</p>
      
       
      <p>
      <b>All speak and no show? Stories take life with our services. Digital Marketing, UI/UX, Design, Website Design and Development and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) are the core services we offer.
      </b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Digital Marketing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brands are no more the portrayal they show on a television commercial or a billboard; they are now about what they ‘speak, feel and look like’ every time you connect. Digital marketing essentially encompasses the different touchpoints of a brand in a digital space - from search engines, website, social media to emails, mobile applications, etc. At BrandStory, we believe in pushing the limits through organic community-building for a brand by telling stories in different mediums and varied touchpoints.  
      </p>

      <p><b>UI - UX</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is essential for brands to understand their audiences well. User experience (UX) research is all about understanding the user at every step of their journey, from gaining awareness about the brand to using the interface and following through with the call to action. User experience, research aids the different decisions that a brand needs to take. The user interface (UI) design is based on UX research and helps in determining how the user will navigate various web interfaces and the kind of story or narrative that is going to reach them at each point. From a holistic view of the brand, we work on the navigation approach while wireframing every single point of interaction as well as further prototyping and testing it! 
      </p>
      <p><b>Website</b></p>
      <p>The World Wide Web is a densely packed space today. Your brand needs to outshine all the digital clutter. Brand presence in diverse relevant mediums is essential and it all starts with a website. A potential consumer should feel inspired by and drawn to the story on the brand website before they become a consumer of your service or product. All narratives and stories scattered around different touchpoints. Including social media should only intrigue and your website is where it should fill all the missing parts of the puzzle. From the web copy to the graphical expression, development, and functional aspects - each needs to be designed for your target consumer and should tell them a story that brings them back!</p>
      
      <p><b>SEO</b></p>
      <p>As contemporary storytellers, we are equipped with more than our flair for words and images - we understand algorithms as well. The trends in search engine optimization (SEO) are constantly evolving today - from voice search to machine learning and personalization of sources for audiences. SEO also helps in determining how audiences behave as well as what they want and seek. Creating brand awareness or securing better rankings on a search engine is no longer about flooding your digital spaces with hashtags, keywords, and building links. Improvements in artificial intelligence have made it crucial for stories to be compelling and well-rooted. </p>

      <p><b>SMM</b></p>
      <p>Social media channels began as promotion and connection platforms but today they have become the storytelling mediums. Brands reveal their different aspects of social media platforms, forming communities of their own with large groups of like-minded people. Storytelling over social media channels is essentially all about consistent storytelling from a brand’s authentic voice. People today get to see beyond the facades, the glam, and glory. They see what happens behind the scenes, they question the actions of a brand and the intent too. Authentic brand stories make a difference and we’re here to write them for you.</p>

      <p><b>Mobile</b></p>

      <p>Smartphones with their revolutionary visual concepts are creating narratives in their ecosystems. Brands have become a part of this ecosystem in many ways - whether it is through social media, brand apps, or other interactions. Storytelling through mobile marketing is an imperative part of the brand experience since this is where consumers spend most of their time today and they want to be constantly engaged. Content is going ahead by leaps and bounds, and personal curation is at its peak now - and it all runs on brand stories. The time for pushing your brand through explicit advertisement is over - today it is about the story you are trying to tell the world.

      'content' : `<p>What started as a doubtful journey by Amazon and Paypal, has now become one of the most successful phenomena of the century. E-commerce has had an upward trajectory of evolution since its creation. E-commerce websites today are not just a product of intense market research, but also a product of changing client needs. Just as the online marketplaces have brought up revolutionary changes as per the customer requirements, the customers themselves have adapted to the changing market scenario for consumer goods. </p>

      <p ><b>What are some major e-commerce trends that are influenced by client needs?</b>
      </p>

      <p><b>Beyond Geography:</b></p>
 
      <p>One of the most revolutionary changes in e-commerce marketplaces has to be global transactions. Seamless supply chains and the power to pay globally without currency being the problem has made many small scales and domestic online businesses evolve on a global level and reach a colossal customer base. Customers too are loving the unparalleled freedom of choice they get from shopping via international websites. 
      </p>

      <p><b>On Palm Click:</b></p>
      <p>Mobile purchasing has given a whole new dimension to the world of e-commerce. These numbers are enough to show the impact of the increased mobile using habits of the customers on the evolution of e-commerce websites.</p>     
      
      <p>It is not only easy to reach a customer through a mobile website, but it is also easy for the customer to order anything on the go through their mobile phone. It is an evident fact that desktops are now out of fashion and the number of customers shopping from their desktops has significantly decreased. </p>
      
       
      <p>
      <b>What role does social media marketing have to play in the evolution of e-commerce websites?
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>As far as the evolution of e-commerce websites is concerned, economic and human behavioural characteristics are the only two significant things that are causing a constant flux in the field. The revolutionary social media marketing tactics now inculcated in the business expansion plans of e-commerce websites are solely triggered by the increased usage of social media by the customers. Over the past two decades, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest have seen a dramatic surge in the number of regular users. 
      </p>
      <p>Taking the e-commerce marketplace to these social media platforms was a very obvious step in their evolution. Majority of online businesses today are spending a huge fortune on social media marketing and some of them are even launching their sites from their social media accounts. 
      </p>

      <p>It is quite obvious that the evolution of shopping spree is going to have a powerful impact on the virtual world of e-commerce. Many new inventions in the field of e-commerce marketplaces are a result of anthropology and customer satisfaction.

      'overview' : 'Email marketing is a viable and relevant marketing tool for businesses ',
      'content' : `<p>Two search engine giants, Google and Bing, have been dominating the web advertisement world. Facebook, the uncrowned king of social media platforms, follows them closely behind.</p>

      <p >Google had a total market share of 91.7% in January 2010 and its market share, as of January 2019, was a staggering 89.9%. Bing had a market share of 3.5% in January 2010, rising to 3.99% in January 2019. Among social media platforms, Facebook leads with 65.88% of the market share [1] [3].
      </p>

      <p>Google Adwords offers a search-engine driven marketing platform, allowing advertisers to target their customers by means of showing advertisements on the basis of a keyword search. Internet Explorer has Bing as the default search engine, which facilitates connecting users and advertisements on the browser. Facebook allows its advertisers to utilize data based on demographics, location, psychographics, and the interests of its users.
      </p>

       

      <p>Google, Bing, and Facebook have their own share of regular users; each uses a different strategy of advertising. Therefore, a clear winner is difficult to ascertain.
      </p>

      <p><b>What’s more?</b></p>
      <p>The specialty of Facebook ads lies in its efficacy to create brand awareness as well as in its ability to launch a new product to unknown audiences. With over one billion active users every day, Facebook’s reach in terms of regularly engaging audiences with the latest advertising content is unmatched over social media platforms.</p>     
      
      <p>Google Adwords, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the target, re-target, and engage new and existing potential customers. A number of recent studies, in fact, have shown that Facebook ads often lead to a transition to Google searches. Once customers see Facebook ads, they might want to explore more about it over a Google or Bing search to perform a little more research. Statistically, Google dominates search engine volumes with around 3.5 billion searches each day [1].</p>
      
       
      <p>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>

      <p>There are abundant examples today which suggest that the companies that have utilized Facebook, Google, or Bing for advertising their products have achieved excellent results. 
      </p>
      <p>Facebook is, without a doubt, the top choice for B2C advertising with its reach and retention capabilities, with dominating the marketing share on the social media end [1]. Presently, Google searches have started to 'decide' the advertisements that are shown to users. Bing ads, on the other hand, provide comprehensive content and leave a longer impact on the minds of audiences, which can be proven by the fact that the Click-Through-Rate (CTC) of Bing ads was 34% higher than Google Adwords [2].</p>

      <p>Each option comes with its own benefits and helps various businesses around the world.</p>
      <p>Rather than opting for a single option, companies can use the ad-space in each of these platforms, by focusing on the strong suits of each of the platforms for a superlative outreach.

      'content' : `<p>Email marketing is a viable and relevant marketing tool for businesses, brands, and marketers alike. Email marketing campaigns are driven by multifarious business strategies. In order to succeed, you must have your own checklist while planning your email marketing campaign.</p>

      <p >Email marketing mistakes have been aplenty, even in the case of seasoned marketers. Ask them and you’ll find horrifying anecdotes about wrong senders, continual email bombarding to the wrong target group, missing out on key details, bad links or poor images, typos’ in content, and lots more! Avoid such situations and get your email marketing campaign right with the right checklist.
      </p>

      <p><b>Subject Matter</b></p>

      <p><ul>
      <li>Relevancy of Subject Line to the Database is the most important factor to account for. Craft subject lines relevant to your business goals or current marketing objectives. Do not waste the time of your customers</li>
      <li>Instead of bombarding readers with multiple products and services, you should choose the ones which are currently being highlighted by the company or the flagship offerings. </li>
      <li>Check for a personal touch throughout the mailer that has a relaxed and user-friendly tone while encouraging a call to action or comment.</li>
      <li>The email marketing campaign should have a clearly defined goal/subject</li>
      <li>There should be a subject line which attracts people to click on it. 
      </li>
      <li>The names of the sender and the brand should be clear along with the return email address. </li>
      <li>There should be replacements for the default images and text in the email marketing template.</li>
      <li>There should be working links which have been embedded into logos, images, and other links/buttons.</li>
      <li>The call to action should be clear there and should be in sync with what you are trying to get your readers to do. </li>
      <li>Make sure that you have proofread your content and that there are no typos or spelling/grammatical mistakes.</li>
      <li>Short sentences should be used in order to make the message clearer and complicated industry jargons should be avoided. </li>
      <li>The preview text should be optimized properly. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p><b>Technical Aspects </b>
      </p>
      

      <p > <ul>
      <li>Check for permissions and send to double opt-in or opt-in contacts only. </li>
      <li>Have an unsubscribe or opt-out option that can be easily availed by readers.</li>
      <li>Check whether you have segmented your contact list on the basis of their requirements and other interests. Email marketing list segmentation is really crucial in this regard in order to target the right audience. </li>
      <li>Make sure that the preview functions properly on tablets, mobile phones, and desktops/laptops.</li>
      <li>Always have test mails dispatched to a testing list across multiple email clients. </li>
      <li>The preview should be functioning for multiple email clients as well.</li>
      <li>The pre-header should be suitably made as well.</li>
      <li>Rendering has to be suitably done for dynamic text/images. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>Time Management</b>
      </p>
       
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>The email marketing campaign should be scheduled properly in terms of time and date. </li>
      <li>Make sure that special occasions or events are properly highlighted in your campaigns if relevant at the right time without being overtly late. </li></ul>
      </p>

      <p>Following these steps ensure an optimal result in the consumer front, and makes your marketing campaign stand out from your competitors.</p>
      <p>Email marketing campaigns have to be absolutely impeccable since reports state that a large majority of potential customers will naturally hit the unsubscribe button since they get fed up with a deluge of emails from one brand. Agreed, email marketing offers great returns, but only if done right. The above-mentioned checklist will help you navigate email marketing campaigns with care while ensuring that you increase and retain your customer base without putting them off.

      'content' : `<p>Concentrated effort towards building trust and relationships and portraying a professional appearance are the key components in Website Design for B2B companies.</p>

      <p >Areas that need to be winning in a B2B website are:</p>

      <p><b>Content:</b> Decision making in B2B companies are complex. Gathering vendor information, vetting service providers, mapping market price and standards are few of the many processes that can prolong the otherwise long decision-making process.</p>

      <p>It is necessary to portray detailed information on the website and in the form of white papers, case studies, and industry reviews while establishing expertise to scale your reputation. Marketing success also depends on informing buyers in all stages of a purchase lifecycle about your products, experience, skills, and services.
      </p>

      <p><b>User Pathways:</b> B2B websites usually have to cater to different user groups, from small to large sized companies, across different departments, functions, and roles. It is important to ensure that there are distinct user pathways for different stakeholders who have different goals and needs and to direct them with appropriate menu options to their desired page. Confusing user pathways that add cognitive load on end users seldom make it past the trial period.
      </p>
    

      <p ><b>Product Details:</b> The products involved in B2B activities are usually complex, expensive, and part of a larger system. Hence, it is important to provide specific technical details to understand if it fits with the client’s existing system. Good B2B websites give information about products, the standards and certifications, compatibility with other machinery, technical support, software, etc. to enable the client to know how the product is compatible with and benefits their own system in the long run.
      </p>
      
     
      <p><b>Focus on Lead Generation:</b> B2B websites focus on lead generation over getting high volumes of visitors to their website. It is essential to make Calls to Action visible to induce users to submit their details which can then be used to generate leads. This is an important step to ensure online marketing success for B2B firms. 
      </p>
      
    
      <p><b>Functional Design:</b> B2B firms need to convey professionalism and expertise. Using functional and minimalistic designs convey seriousness while conveying relevant information for B2B firms. This creates an uncluttered experience that is also easy to navigate while directing focus on the features of the product rather than the user interface of the website itself.
      </p>

      <p><b>User Personas:</b> B2B website visitors are from different departments, roles, and functions, and may even be from different industries. Hence, content and navigation must consider different user personas and provide relevant information for different user needs. Decision makers such as managers may require information regarding costs and outcomes, whereas, actual users of products may be concerned with only product features and benefits. Helpful navigation and content based on different users highlights the attention to detail, which justifies the relatively higher cost of B2B products.
      </p>

      <p>A B2B website design should targets specific user personas, showcasing the product features which are tailored, with enough flexibilities, to suit specific needs of end users. Add to that a focus on lead generation and with enough traffic, you have a B2B website which aids a company's marketing efforts.

      'title':'All You Need to Know about Voice Search Optimization',
      'overview' : 'The value of UX is often underrated as companies give more priority to their product',
      'content' : `<p>With giant leaps in technology, how people use their devices to search for information online is undergoing a rapid change. There is prominent use of voice search across multiple forums like Siri in Apple Devices, Google Voice Search on Android and Cortana in Windows. Hence, it is essential for businesses to look at content differently and optimize it for voice search and assistants.</p><p >It is essential for companies to note that voice search is not merely a fad and here are some statistics to prove the same:</p>

      <p>Voice Search stands at the third position on the list of SEO Trends for 2017 and beyond, and one example is the fact that one-fifth of Google’s searches are voice-based queries. This new technology of voice search has made it very easy for a user to gain information from their device on a question-answer basis. It allows interaction with the machine to be performed naturally and conversationally. One can use a simple voice command to get information on the weather, play music, turn on lights, order products or check the weather forecast.</p>

      <p>Now that we know voice search is a crucial SEO tool, the question is how to optimize data for voice search. Historically, people typed relevant keywords on a search engine to find what they were looking for. The first thing to remember in voice search optimization is that unlike keyword phrases in a search engine, voice search is more conversational and natural. It is also flexible and focused. In a nutshell, voice search queries are more prolonged than text questions.</p>

      <p>Here’s a set of advice from experts related to voice search optimization:</p>
      <br>
      <p class="blog-p"><b class="py-3">1. Increase the speed of your page</b></p>
      <p>Though there is no direct link between speed and voice search optimization, fast loading sites have higher a search engine ranking which in turn impacts voice rankings.</p>
      <br>

      <p ><b>2. Use Normal Speech</b></p>
      <p>Digital assistants are engineered to process conversational and straightforward language. Google Data of 2017 shows that 70% of all voice searches on Google use a natural flow of language. This indicates a need for a shift from traditional keyword terminology; if you’re looking for an automobile repair shop use key-phrases like “Where is the nearest automobile repair shop”?</p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>3.Use Long-Tail Keywords</b></p>
      <p>As mentioned before, voice search queries are longer than text queries because they are specific. These specific keywords provide an opportunity, even for smaller companies to rank high on Google Search results. For example, a brand that sells antique bronze jewelry and artifacts is more likely to be viewed in a search for “antique bronze jewelry” rather than “jewelry“ as larger companies will dominate the latter.</p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>4. Use Location to your benefit</b></p>
      <p>Since most of the voice-based searches are to find information about services ‘nearby’, use the location of your business in all your features.</p>

      <p>Voice search optimization is a trend that grows beyond the abrupt keywords of yesterday’s search engine trends, and a planned and effective use of this strategy can prove to be an immense contribution to the growth of your brand.</p>

      <p>Evolving trends can be quite unnerving especially when they require changes to design and code. Approaching digital consultants, like BrandStory for example, will make the process much simpler. If you’re looking for the Best SEO agency in Bangalore, you have arrived at the right place.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Marketing is an art of convincing consumers to buy the product of a particular brand.',
      'content' : `<p>Marketing is an art of convincing consumers to buy the product of a particular brand. Numerous strategies tactics have evolved to empower brand to attract more customers. Initially, it was only limited to physical campaigns. The advent of digital platforms slowly changed the scenario of companies enthusiastic to utilize the social media networks more for marketing their brand. Now, the trend of solely digital marketing is slowly fading out. People now want the credible physical presence of the company but in an innovative way. That is why it is time to go ‘phygital’ with social media marketing campaigns. The merging of ‘physical’ and ‘digital’ has revolutionized the overall approach toward marketing.</p>

<p><b>Be 'Phygital' because Customers are 'Phygital'</b></p>
<p>The convergence of physical and digital approaches is justified because online users have a real existence and they are to own and use a product physically after all! Thus, live demonstration events are appreciated by the consumers when they experience those through their own eyes. According to a 2013 eConsultancy report, 40% US consumers find the nearest store of a specific retailer via smartphone.</p>

<p><b>Engage the Consumers</b></p>
<p>Users feel appreciated when they are interacted with. You have obviously noticed that the potential customers love it when they are involved in the marketing activity. A 'phygital' campaign should be engaging and engrossing in nature. Planning a contest is an interesting method. KitKat Australia arranged a contest where customers had to buy a product to enter a digitally run contest. This is a very common but effective way of implementing ‘phygital’. You can come up with your own plan but do not forget to focus the mass centrally.</p>

<p><b>Infuse New Technology</b></p>
<p>This is the age of not being technically correct but technologically one-of-its-kind. Users find it fascinating if they can access the digital arena from a physical realm. The Argentinean club called Club Atlético Tigre offered its fans to enter the stadium with "Passion Ticket" on the basis of their excitement level. A RFID microchip was infused in each fan’s body to measure the excitement level via special scanners at every entrance. Implantation of 1000 chip was reported within two days of the campaign launch. 3D projection mapping as a marketing tool has also gained immense popularity as patterns through lights were created on huge geometric structures.</p>

<p><b>Be Quirky</b></p>
<p>Anything odd and weird strikes human eyes very easily. This is the main reason behind the huge success of “The Man Your Man Can Smell Like” advertising campaign. It was started as a television commercial but it became an internet viral because of the quirky way of speaking about unrelated things by the man in the clip. You may choose any one or combine each to create a great 'phygital' campaign for your customer experience to increase your brand value. A prudent mixture of strategies that are backed by research are sure to bring in huge results.</p>`,

      'title':'Accentuate Your Business with Excellent UX',
      'overview' : 'The value of UX is often underrated as companies give more priority to their product',
      'content' : `<p>The value of UX is often underrated as companies give more priority to their product promotion and sales. Better UX design paves the way for better business. Some findings by Adobe inform that the market share of creative design companies is 1.5 times greater and companies that are attentive to design and usability have surpassed their performance by 219%. These striking statistics are enough to rush for building an excellent UX design.</p>

<p>Why UX has to be Good</b></p>
<p>The website is the face of a company on the internet. Most of the users judge a company primarily on the basis of their online interface. If it takes longer than few seconds for a user to understand how a website or an app works, then it loses potential customers. User experience is the most important factor in search engine optimization as well. Google algorithms assesses each website in terms how useful and convenient it is to the users.</p>

<p><b>Appearance Matters</b></p>
<p>A unique presentation of website always attracts eyes which are used to looking through conventional and old designs. For example, earlier a website used to be segregated into some typical pages. Each page was dedicated to a section. The types of pages are still same but the appearance has changed now. Most of the websites let the users see a glimpse of all the pages and let them choose which page they want to go with. The design is another major factor in appearance. For example, as soon as you enter the website of the Feed music, you will feel you are roaming in a cosmic realm.</p>

<p><b>Easy Navigation</b></p>
<p>This feature is very important especially for the e-commerce sites. For e-commerce websites or any website for that matter, it should be looked after that the user can find quickly what they look for and more importantly that should suffice their need. Most of the airline websites have usability issues but Virgin America stands apart from the lot. It is clear with instruction and navigation. One can book a flight without any hassle and confusion.</p>

<p><b>Informative</b></p>
<p>Content is perceived as the king in the website. Each user has the purpose of fetching information while surfing through different websites. Information is infused into content. However, the first two factors play a significant role in letting the users reach to the content. If a user finds it difficult to navigate, then there is fair chance that user would not visit the site again. However, a website should not start bombarding information, right from the Home page – most single paged websites do this. Even too much information does no good if not presented nicely.</p>

<p><b>Responsive</b></p>
<p>Users quite often leave queries and questions on the website. Also, feedback is submitted for a particular product, service or for the website itself. Moreover, your website should be positively answering the question of the users. Unresponsive sites lessen traffic drastically and search engine algorithms send them into oblivion. Thus, design your UX in the best possible ways to provide the most impressive experience to the users and make sure to remain away from stagnancy.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Local business often immerses into oblivion due to poor visibility to its targeted consumers. <a href="assets/images/seo-company-bangalore/">Search engine optimization</a> works like a magic wand to clear the fog and let your targeted audience see what you have to offer to them. Usage of smartphones and other devices has increased the count of potential customers who are always online. SEO permutes and combines different strategies and tactics to accentuate the online visibility of a brand or company to your targeted audiences.</p>
<p>SEO comprises different strategies based on the product, location, targeted consumers. Thus, not all strategies are universally successful to transform a business to a treasure trove. You must consult and hire a search engine optimizer to carry out the burden for you. There are certain dos and don’ts which are necessary to follow to make the most out of SEO. Local businesses have a limited budget for marketing and promotion and they should focus on SEO and implement it correctly.</p>
<h4><b>Let’s check out the important dos first:</b></h4>
<p><b>1.Create Google+ and Google place for each location of the same business</b><br>
This is basic and it is better to start off with basic. Google creates a free listing on Google+ and Google Place pages and you have your potentials customers only typing some keywords away. The free listing is displayed along with the search results on both computer and smartphones. Do not keep your customer waiting to find where you exist and then reach you because there is a chance he/she may lose interest in you by the time they finally drop into your business location.</p>
<p><b>2. Bring consistency in NAP listing, citations and on-page reference</b><br>
Local SEO majorly depends on NAP citations or the Name, Address and Phone. Google gives equal significance to them like links in traditional SEO.<br>
Trusted third-party websites such as Yell and UKPlaces are the best place to begin with NAP citations. According to the Moz’s Local Search Ranking Factors Report, out of the six elementary ranking factors, 3 are associated with the NAP citations. While evaluating, the consistency, and the accuracy of the business address, phone number and the business name throughout the online world is judged.</p>
<p><b>3. Infuse local search strategy with Google+ </b><br>
This is an effective way to optimize personalized search. You can make your listing more appealing to your users by adding images, your website link etc.</p>
<h4><b>Now it’s time to know the main don’ts:</b></h4>
<p><b>1. Do not put fake reviews</b><br>
Many brands hire writers to compose fake reviews on Google to boost up the ranking. Faking is an art and such artists are very rare in this world. Your probable chance of meeting them is very low. So it is better you never buy on that and let the people organically come up with reviews.<br>
Encourage your customers to leave reviews on Google and on the third-party websites.</p>
<p><b>2. Never take your online reputation lightly</b><br>
Take care of the customer service you provide, because this counts. All good reviews will add up to the online reputation of your business, but one negative review can ruin everything. It will take a toll on your business, leading to serious effects. Therefore, besides offering an excellent customer service, pay enough heed to your online reputation, rule out any negative feedback with patience and positive attributes.</p>
<p>There are more strategies for your local business, but it is advisable to look for an expert who can suggest you the absolute needs tailored to your business. So think positive, think SEO!</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Blog is a big playground for a writer’s creativity. Each blog post serves a common purpose of boosting the Search Engine ranking of the website. You must be wondering how possibly a blog, a personalized write up can do that! Blog is the platform where you can share information, awareness, knowledge and expertise on your product with the community or with your potential customers. Blog is the best tool to attract your customers.</p>
<p><b>Blog Actively-Make your Presence Feel</b><br>
Google ignores those sites which are left stagnant and unchanged for years together. There are plenty of such sites floating in the spectrum of World Wide Web. The search engines strictly monitors the latest updates of every website. If you post two-three blogs a week, then you are seizing the maximum opportunity of updating your website organically. It symbolises that your blog is active and that it is been taken care of. Search Engines hate idle blogs and websites.</p>
<p>However, the blog content should be potential enough to pull a lot of visitors and spend the time to read it. It must talk about a topic that the search engines can consider worth sending to the users.</p>
<p><b>Add More Pages-Reason to stay longer</b><br>
The more the numbers of pages, the more the search engines crawl across your website. If your website is a mine of excellent blogs and those have gone viral on social media platforms, you will be able to gain more visitors. When these visitors are spending longer time on your blog, it indicates that the blog has some good information that they are interested in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with limited pages in your website, you cannot widen the usage of the keywords, which is the soul of SEO. If that is the case, you may have to stuff your existing content with the same keywords, which is again a threat to ranking in the search engine result pages.</p>
<p><b>Inbound Links to Increase the Authenticity</b><br>
Contents on a blog must have inbound links as references. Search engines identify these inbound links as a vote of confidence. More the inbound links, more visitors spend time in your website for several related information. This increases the authenticity of the website in the eyes of the search engines.</p>
<p><b>Keywords to increase the Visibility</b><br>
Playing with keywords in the blog is a must, and there are enormous opportunities to do this. Optimizing all the blogs with relevant keywords and linking these keywords with inbound links, makes your blog an information mine. When users type same keywords on the Google search box, Google identifies all the pages in your blog containing the keyword, and displays them in the search engine result pages. It increases the visibility of the blog, raises the number of clicks.</p>
<p><b>Socializing your Blogs</b><br>
Once your blogs are updated with new contents, you can share the blogs in the social media sites for engaging more number of people to know about your blog, product and services. As you receive positive comments on the blogs, it adds up to the ranking of your website, because search engines are smart, they gather information from all places about a product, to judge on the parameters of ranking.</p>
<p>Thus blogging is a very important factor playing behind the ranking of a website. You must keep your blog active so that you can keep yourself running in the competition. So start blogging today.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Marketing has considerably changed over the years.',
      'content' : `<p>Marketing has considerably changed over the years. With time, people have started realizing the potential of social media. It has compelled organizations to incorporate the aspects of <a href="assets/images/services/social-media-marketing-agency-bangalore/">social media marketing</a> in the overall mixture of the marketing mix. It was closely observed that social media marketing was mostly grasped by the companies that were B2C. Most of the B2B companies are severely sceptical about the advantages that social media places on the companies. As the B2C companies were the ones to adopt this marketing within a short span of time so it clearly puts forth the difference between the B2B and B2C marketing.</p>
<p><b>Let us have a look at some of the distinctions between social media marketing of B2B and B2C companies:</b></p>
<p><b>Content –</b> Content is no longer limited only to words, it has been oriented to visual, audio and interactive content these days. The messaging within the social post is now treated to be content. Content is solely the provider of value to the reader. While B2C marketers come up with creative contests, GIFs, videos and more interactive content, the B2B marketers, on the other hand, focus mainly on the professional type of content. B2B marketers mainly make use of certain types of content which can be explained in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>White papers or eBooks- whitepapers were observed to serve a plethora of advantageous purposes for all the B2B marketers. It can be stated that whitepaper is one of the greatest tools of the lead generation which is a great goal or objective for the B2B marketers. In the course of providing information to the reader, people are more willing to access the details.</li>
<li>Case studies- These are also an effective tool for a lead generation which proves to the target that the product is a suitable choice for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Channel –</b> With the proliferation of the social channels, people are observing the niche of the social network that focuses on the forms of communication. Some of the effective channels for B2C are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook- it is a standard and the first social channel which turned out to be the most effective. It is an excellent tool for engagement, promotion and customer support.</li>
<li>Instagram- with this channel, visual content becomes an incredibly effective tool for the B2C marketers. Selfies are a good choice.</li>
<li>Youtube- Creation of fun and interesting videos makes the B2B marketers grab the attention of the viewers. The polished videos give more personality to the company.</li>
<li>Twitter- Having a Twitter account is really handy for real time updates and with the use of hashtags, companies become a part of the trending conversations in various out of the box ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For B2B:</b><br>
There are mainly 3 social networks which can be focused by the marketers that are LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. These channels are leveraged not only for the purpose of engagement but also for the distribution of content.</p>
<p>The dichotomy clearly states the differences between the social media marketing of B2C as against B2B. it can be stated that both B2B and B2C marketers are utilizing the benefits of social media marketing at its best.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Any product’s appeal (and therefore its sale) that your company has put up for its consumers basically depends on two criteria',
      'content' : `<p>Any product’s appeal (and therefore its sale) that your company has put up for its consumers basically depends on two criteria –</p>
<p>1. How user-friendly and satiating it is at its usability.<br>
2. How appealing and friendly is the packaging/interactive layer that the user uses to utilize your product?</p>
<p>The first factor is a simplified definition of the <strong>UX Design</strong> (i.e, the <a href="assets/images/ui-design-company-bangalore/">User Experience design</a>) of your product, while the latter signifies the <strong>UI</strong>(User-Interface)<strong>Design.</strong></p>
<p>Although these terms are generally used in reference to cyber products (software and apps offering services and solutions), they are not limited to the domain.</p>
<p>An awesome application with extensive features and usability cannot possibly reach the zenith of its potential if it’s wrapped with a weak, unfriendly, unattractive interaction surface. Similarly, even an invoking, arousing, appealing and interactive base cannot sky-shot the sales of a product whose basic layer of application and usability (or ‘back-end’ as developers call it) is flawed.</p>
<p>Thus, both UI and UX design need to go hand in hand to come up with the best end-results.<br>
So, here’s a list of what you as a company could do differently this year to come up with the best UI/UX combo for your users:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the Co-dependence</strong> –The first important thing to understand is how UI and UX intermingle with each other. Pay heed to the para above, let this be a reminder that the efforts are fulfilling only if they meet the requirements from end-to-end.</li>
<li><strong>Know, understand and focus on your audience and their requirements</strong> – Don’t beat around the bush and be satisfied if one of those blows randomly lands on it! Spend time and resources on understanding your exact/targeted user-base and then follow an objective designing methodology catering to pre-decided specifications and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it Simple</strong> – Simplicity preludes an underlying elegance. Your users need to be impressed by the elegance of your product’s design and workflow, not overwhelmed by the complexity of it all.<br>
If you’re designing one of those versatile, flexible and thus, seemingly complex things, try to use as many of those popularly familiar features (for instance, ‘drag and drop’ for computer designs) as you can. Innovate and experiment with implications and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Care to gather feedback, and act on it</strong> – The last one on this list, but probably the most important and often the most neglected as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumer feedback on both UX as well as UI and timely action on it is a necessary iterative cycle that can help you constantly improve your product and services. This not only leaves you better off than before but also helps highlight your goodwill, indulgence and concern amidst the consumer base!</p>
<p>That’s a series of simple resolutions you could take this year to enhance not only your consumers’ experience but also the interface they experience it through.<br>
We wish you a creative and a prosperous new year!</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Ever thought of what would have happened had Steve Jobs thought of the common user while offering double-priced computers, or Rolls Royce thought of reaching out to the general masses while designing its classy cars?<br>
The world might have never witnessed the coming in of the cutting-edge computer technology, or of those super luxurious “Bas Naam hi kaafi Hai” cars – at least in this era!</p>
<p>But what’s the thing that these and countless other similar success stories have in common?<br>
Simply put – A belief!<br>
A belief – in not only their product and its quality, but in the consumers as well ie no matter how offbeat you are, if you have a confidence in your products, then be confident that if presented correctly, the right consumer will come to you!<br>
The same can be extended to the content marketing industry. Seems like drawing distant parallels? Well, wait up!</p>
<p>In the present scenario of having infinite amounts of Search Engine Optimized content floating around (about which users are increasingly becoming aware), what sets a brand apart is its genuineness.<br>
People now know that the link that shows up at the top of the Search Results page isn’t necessarily the thing they’ve been looking for! The aware user acts oblivious to those search engine rankings and does care to scroll down, to find something that has some excellent content to offer in return – that is appealing to him and his needs and not the machine.</p>
<p>So, when you ask a writer to create content for your online handle, that’s meant (in the actual sense) to appeal to people and their needs instead of to a ranking algorithm, he’ll be writing to someone who understands – a human, whose emotions and needs can be appealed to and who understands why the content and wordplay is superior to those who have just used “Peter Patting Potato” or some similar, trivial “keyword” in the write-up 10 times. And thus, all the content on your website is genuine, meaningful and thus appeals to your customers out there who are in the lookout for brands like you!</p>
<p>The benefitting factor with this approach is that only the right consumers who likes what you have to offer, cares to find you in the first place, approaches your organisation – and you don’t get featured on every random search. Well, inshort – genuine leads, isn’t that what we all want?</p>
<p>So, take a stand and go out there targeting your user, and not a machine or an algorithm – for he’s the one you wish to make relations with, not that web page that pops up when you type insignificant search words onto a blank bar.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'In this digital era, maximum businesses have turned to the various digital medium of marketing and have realized the importance',
      'content' : `<p>In this digital era, maximum businesses have turned to the various digital medium of marketing and have realized the importance of this form of media for survival. But the approach required for this medium of advertising is quite different from all others and requires more effort to make it a success. Some business struggle to take full advantage of it due to various reason which differs from business to business.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons why your social campaign has not picked up the pace but let’s have a look at a few common reasons</p>
<p>Firstly, <b>the audience your brand is targeting:</b> Just increasing your followers on the social platforms should not be the main target. If your business is not able to generate the desired sales as expected then check the type of audience your social handles have. There is a high probability that you’re targeting on the wrong platforms. Try to determine what type of social media your prospective customers use and then make your presence felt there.</p>
<p>Once you’re on the right platform and have a sizable number of following, you should<b> keep them engaged.</b> They have some expectations from you, they would want to be regularly updated and this requires<b> consistency.</b> If you’re going through with social media campaign it should be done with full enthusiasm and requires a good amount of investment as regard to time and effort. If consistency is not maintained the customers would feel unwanted and eventually you may end up even losing your fan-base. So, try to<b> maintain a social calendar </b>as to when and what time the updates are to be provided and stick to the schedule or else you can go for <a href="assets/images/services/social-media-marketing-agency-bangalore/">social media marketing company</a> for promotion.</p>
<p>Now that you’re able to engage your audience on the social media platform keep in mind <b>not to over promote yourself</b> as this could result in your followers unfollowing you due to the irritation caused with the self-praise and pushing your products. As they say, too much or too low, both are not good for health so a balance should be maintained to create healthy social campaigns.</p>
<p><b>The type of content</b> posted depends on your goal i.e. Are you trying to get new customers or to get the existing consumers to spend more? So,<b> assess whether the content is in line with your goal.</b></p>
<p>Lastly, <b>keep track of your social media metrics</b> – it is important for the business. The focus should not be on the number of likes and shares your posts have created but the reach and mentions it got and eventually the conversions your social handles are creating. Also, the consumers are more vocal on social media and the growing negative mentions can hurt the business. In the same way, positive feedback from a consumer could be encouraged to spread the good word. In the end, this platform is emerging out as one of the effective media and requires attention as a click is likely to generate more business for your brand.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p><strong>What is UX Design?</strong><br>
UX stands for “User Experience,” and it is merely the effect, an operating platform leaves on its user. The system could be a website, desktop software, a web app or even a mobile application which everyone uses frequently. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) rating gets higher for a system as the user experience gets better.</p>
<p>A UX Designer is a person who correctly knows what and how a person wants to surf the Internet, and accordingly they design their platforms. The UX designers are concerned with the overall feel of the product. Whether it may be the navigation through the website or simply the color combination, it’s all on the bearable shoulders of UX designers. User Experience designer is nowadays becoming equivalently hired as the programmer.</p>
<p>Before one can see the factors being exchanged for the cost of a fantastic UX design, he has to understand what it takes for a “fantastic” UX design.</p>
<p>The Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovery and Planning-Like all the other good things, UX designers too, start with intense brainstorming and planning. This is Particularly Important as each interface demands ineffably different way of approach. During the whole scene, the difference between UI and UX should be clear.<br>
For instance, UI represents a dating profile, and then UX represents the date itself.</li>
<li>Making a Strategy-A sizable portion of UX designer’s cost is covered in this stage, as it serves as the most fundamental and challenging task for them. It takes a lot of time and designer’s hard work with loads of User research.Thankfully, there are several ways to get the User research task to learn about the user base (good for them!). A significant proportion of UX designers employ the most common practices, which is having surveys, polls, interviews, reviews or focus groups. This process is explained in two pretty sentences but takes a lot to complete (as expected).<strong>This involves;</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>User Surveys and Interviews</li>
<li>Journey and Empathy mapping</li>
<li>Rapid Prototyping</li>
<li>User testing</li>
<li>Define design guidelines</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps are essential in the given order. This stage is a very time to consume and research-oriented (not the ones did in Lab, instead of User research!).</p></li>
<li>Mind mapping the UX- It is the step when the designers, design something (finally!). In this step only, the easy platform of “Shareit” and beautiful navigation panel of the Android gets molded. This stage emphasizes more user usage and reviews and the UX is iterated according to their needs and demands. After all the sham, the users are going to show the response, so producing what they require is the goal.</li>
<li>Final Design-The apparent counterpart of UX (which is not), the UI shows up here. After the skeletal design (UX Design) of the product, the looks of it has to be created. The UX Designer has to dress the prototype with inexpensive but beautiful interfaces.UI completes the whole UX process and provides the marketers their projects of marketing the finished product. The UI-ers have to keep in mind the color theory, typography (thanks to Steve Jobs) and other design elements.</li>
<li>Cost of the UX designers-The words and the steps might look alienated, but actually, the real-time scenario is a little different. The real success of a UX is the user satisfaction that can only come through dedicated work of UX Designers. The Cost of UX designers might look steep, but the quality UX is priceless.</li>

      'title':'Confession of a Digital Marketer - 2017',
      'overview' : 'Social media is a good brand communication channel that breaks down the information about a product and services into a more',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">Social media is a good brand communication channel that breaks down the information about a product and services into a more straightforward but frequent method. As a digital marketer, I have experienced a gradual increase in the social media adoption in a brand’s marketing mix working with about with 400+ brands at various verticals and business sizes, I could see. Predominantly, SME’s see social media as a sales tool over an engagement tool. I don’t deny that Social media platforms can also generate leads, but only at a cost. Now the point is, does an SME has a considerable amount of budget and time to streamline Social media campaigns as a lead generator for their sales funnels. SME’s or startups entering social media as their only lead generation source to support their funnel they might end up in disappointment.</p>
<p align="justify">Digital marketing companies generate content and post it on handles expecting magic in sales and revenues. Many marketers will agree that without a post-boost, the cost spent on content will not see the required reach and engagement. As per a <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/facebook-engagement-brands-publishers-falls-20-2017/" target="$_blank">recent research</a> done by Buzzsumo brand pages are seeing a 20% decline in their organic engagement. I honestly suspect the degrowth of the organic engagement is much more than the findings in the last qtr of the year 2017. I am sure that Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Organic-Reach-on-Facebook" target="$_blank">claims</a> the lower organic reach is because of the algorithm that designed based on 1000 factors that are related to an audience on their newsfeed since its attempt of feeding the most relevant content to the customer.</p>
<p align="justify">Suspecting that Facebook is trying to make more money by forcing the brands to increase the spend per post for a higher reach and engagement? Let’s read their quote in one of their QA’s</p>
<p align="justify">“Is organic reach dropping because Facebook is trying to make more money?<br>
No. Our goal is always to provide the best experience for the people who use Facebook. We believe that delivering the best experiences for people also benefits the businesses that use Facebook. If people are more active and engaged with stories that appear in News Feed, they are also more likely to be active and engaged with content from businesses.”</p>
<p align="justify">I went and looked at a comparison between Q3 2016 Net Income vs the Q3 2017 Net income. There is an excess net income of 2,000 Mn USD comparatively to this year’s Q3 against last year Q3. So the quote mentioned above from Facebook is as innocent as saying Iraq had WMD’s and Donald Trump is a better president.</p>
<p align="justify">The only problem with the dominant social media &amp; search platforms I see is that they consistently are encouraging SME’s across the globe to spend more than the larger brands. Because the smaller brands will spend their money quickly in a day or a week, so the platforms can accommodate as many SME’s to spend their money on them, Also the bid rate increases between the number of people ready to invest for their demography and target audience they wanted to reach. Hence leading to a gradual increase in the budget spent by SME’s every year on year but end up with low return on investment.</p>
<p align="justify">These paid platforms built their revenue engine based on the large chunk of small brands rather than the small chunk of the large brands. Till then we would be coming across similar <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/small-and-medium-business-are-advertising-on-facebook-because-it-is-helping-drive-results/articleshow/58164385.cms" target="$_blank">media articles</a> encouraging SME’s to spend more on their platforms. That reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure" target="$_blank">market failure</a> and the Information asymmetry that helps only these social platforms and search engines to be on the side of benefit.</p>
<p align="justify">So the best possible digital marketing strategy for SME’s is to create strong digital assets and have a consistent, long-term but multi-channel digital marketing strategy which focuses on brand reach and impressions alone. Use all the social media platforms as a free content distribution space where you usually spend ad budget on one or two platforms to increase the reach. Lets honestly agree that sales are the by-product of the effective communication that you usually run through the awareness campaign. The large organizations whom so ever already spending a considerable amount of budget now have to focus on the optimisation of the campaign to have the best possible ROI on the usual quantity of the budget spent. Large organizations have to set goals and map their budget spent against the revenues and the demography of the business for continuous improvement.</p>
<p align="justify">For businesses, it’s important to realize that Social media could also be a place where they can generate leads and sales, but it shouldn’t be the only place where business are trying to establish their sales. It would be a disappointment. And also for brands, Paid campaign is not a long-term solution since the cost of the paid campaigns will increase your overall ad budget year on year which will have a major impact on your margins. So balance your current marketing ad budget spent on both paid and organic campaigns, where paid campaigns will give you the immediate impact you try to create based on the budget, and you always build those strong organic assets to reduce the budget dependency of the paid campaigns in the near future.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>UX is the acronym for the “User Experience”, and it is the experience a person gets while working or surfing through a system. The system could be a website, desktop software, a web app or even a mobile application which everyone uses frequently. There is something called the Human-Computer interaction (HCI) rating which gets higher for a system as the user experience gets nicer. User Experience designer is nowadays becoming equivalently hired as the programmer.</p>

<h2><b>Why Is UX Important?</b></h2>
<p>With the rise in digital marketing and e-commerce websites, the user experience is inevitably crucial because this is what turns the user into the potential customer then, eventually a customer. With more ease, a user walks through the system the more profitable the company gets. One of the most common dislikes of any UX design is, ‘They hate advertisements’ especially when they’re intensified on a page.</p>

<p><b>UX Design Execution Process</b><br>
The User Experience Design also referred to as UXD is the process of increasing the customer satisfaction and loyalty by keeping the focus on improving the overall customer pleasure and loyalty between the customer and the product. The User Design Execution should encompass the interactions between a potential or active customer and a company and make it easier.</p>
<p>The UX designers should design the execution process by keeping the focus on User Experience, Advertisers, cost and feasibility reports and design a unique and compatible design. The UX design being a blurry concept can’t be defined in concrete terms, and hence one can’t differentiate the UX designer from the advertiser or the web developer.</p>

<h2>UX Design Execution Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Team</li>
<li>The Design framework</li>
<li>The Design Engineering</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
<li>Validation</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>

<p><b>The Process</b><br>
1. The Team- The UX Design is not particular to only designers instead of a teamwork between the Designers, the Engineers and Product Managers. The trilogy plays and serves to the successful UX design.</p>
<p>2. The Design framework- Any design process is iterative and should be done by learning the faults and mistakes as we go. The first draft of the design is just to know where actually we’re placing the components of the web page, mobile or web application. The framework generally includes the List Pane, Card Pane, Navigation bar and Cards.</p>
<p>3. The Design Engineering- This step makes sure that if the product provides the right experience or not. If not, then the engineers must improvise or even change their ambitions of the product.</p>
<p>4. Prototyping- In this step, the model of the project is made and is circulated among the top customers; it is often called beta testing. The focus of this stage is to create awareness about the product and mainly to find the shortcomings of the design.</p>
<p>5. Validation- This step focuses on validating the product with different elements. The customer feedbacks are received and validated, and the report for the Revision is made.</p>
<p>6. Conclusion- This is the last step where the UX designers see that if the product is well and can be released to market or requires revision and iteration.</p>
<p><b>UX and Ads</b><br>
The solution is “Targeted Marketing” which is a straightforward concept of ‘showing what they want’. Whenever a person searches something on the Internet, it means either they’re looking for it or just collecting information, and if here the marketers impose their ads the users are likely to buy the product or services.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'User experience and customer experience are more often than not used interchangeably.',
      'content' : `<p>User experience and customer experience are more often than not used interchangeably. However, these 2 concepts are not exactly similar. Let us discuss both of these terms in detail to know how they are different from each other.</p>
<p>Customer Experience is more of an umbrella term in itself. Customer experience is a larger concept as compared to the user experience. It has been gaining importance of late and finding a place in managerial vocabulary. However, just like it is very difficult to define terms like “design” and “creativity”, interpreting this phrase is not that simple. Customer experience is the experience that a customer has whenever they interact with a certain company or brand. It defines the how the relationship is between a provider and user of the product. It is the product of an interaction between an organisation and a customer over the duration of their relationship and comprises of customer service, advertising, brand reputation, sales process and product delivery. Customers respond differently to direct and indirect contact with a company. The overall experience reflects how the customer feels about the company and its offerings. Customer experience is the one thing that could effectively differentiate you from your competitors. Better the customer experience the more customers you retain. But, not many people engage in its practice. Why though? Simply because it is a very complex process. Creating a great customer experience requires enormous amounts of collaboration across groups in a company that often work independently. Working together can be a herculean task if you are very used to working singly and that’s what makes the framework for customer experience so challenging.</p>
<p>A company looking to improve its customer experience needs first to understand the layers that this concept is made of. Firstly, the client’s journey needs to be analysed, touch points need to be provided to support their journey with the company, and lastly, an in-depth study of the ecosystems integrated with the products and services that the brand offers needs to be conducted to devise a customer experience strategy. All these, if followed in the right direction, will definitely give best results to the companies.</p>
<p>User experience refers to a person’s perceptions and responses resulting from the use or the anticipated use of a product, system or service. What is the difference then between user experience and customer experience? User experience is a subset of customer experience. In essence, if you added up the sum of all knowledge on each individual user experience, you would be able to explain your customer experience. Examples make everything comprehensible. Say you download a new software. However, when you access it, you find it to be very confusing and difficult to operate. This would mean a bad user experience. However, they have a helpline, and an operator explains to you step-by-step as to how to run the software. This would mean a good customer experience. So while user experience may be one part of customer experience, it is very essential and cannot be overlooked. </p>`,

      'title':'Have you heard? A Bad User Interface Is a Cranky Receptionist',
      'overview' : 'Whenever you enter an office, a hotel or any other organization,',
      'content' : `<p>Whenever you enter an office, a hotel or any other organization, your initial contact happens with a receptionist, maybe young woman in a formal skirt or a man in his thirties wearing a tie. Naturally, the impression that you make of the receptionist is the impression you make of the organization. It is a common belief that receptionists are supposed to be polite, have basic knowledge of the organization and can ruin your entire visit if they are rude. Similarly, a user interface is your contact to the world of binaries and codes.</p>
<p>It is the medium through which you interact with and understand your everyday devices. And a bad or a confusing user interface means difficulty in operating the devices. There are some qualities which are shared by great receptionists and user interfaces.</p>
<p><b>1. Clarity-</b> This means the interface makes everything clear through language and visual elements. A receptionist who is clear in her language and gestures is better than the one whose speech is unclear.</p>
<p><b>2. Concision-</b> In order to make sure that everything is transparent to the user if the interface is loaded with information and has labelled things that don’t need to be labelled. As a result in a heavy intake to the user. The key is finding the balance between being concise and still being clear.</p>
<p><b>3. Familiarity-</b> In the era of a million options, the users deal with a lot of interfaces. So even though it is necessary for the interface to be clear and easy in its own way, it is also important that some basic features remain the same.</p>
<p><b>4. Responsiveness-</b> When a receptionist doesn’t respond to your inquiry about a spare key card, it’s simply annoying. Similarly, when an interface doesn’t respond to the user or provide a feedback of the ongoing process, it is bound to leave the user in confusion.</p>
<p><b>5. Consistency-</b> Keeping the interface consistent throughout the application or the website would help establish a pattern in the user’s mind. Like you would remember a specific organization if all their receptionists greet you in a particular uniform manner.</p>
<p><b>6. Aesthetics-</b> While the interface can work without icing on top, it won’t hurt to make it look appealing, especially if it lasts in the user’s mind.</p>
<p><b>7. Efficiency-</b> A good interface works efficiently, containing possible shortcuts and quick responses to the user’s queries.</p>
<p>Your interface is the agent through which your users will know about your product. And if the users like your interface, they are very likely to remember it and associate your website or application with it. A good user interface can even make the user get habituated to it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a bad user interface, which doesn’t have the sense of familiarity to other interfaces and is not able to clarify its responses to you, is like a cranky receptionist whose language is not clear to you and you wish to leave the organization as soon as your work is done!</p>`,

      'overview' : 'It has become a small world, indeed. But how did this transformation happen in the first place?',
      'content' : `<p>It has become a small world, indeed. But how did this transformation happen in the first place? The advent of information technology began with computers and laptops; however, today it has a taken a new turn, getting a boost with the increasing production and sales of smartphones. Be it searching for an address on Google maps or internet banking, people today prefer using their smartphones for fulfilling almost every task.</p>
<p>Hence, businesses today must tap into the potential of such consumer behaviour and make the most of it. Websites today must be attractive, interactive and user-friendly, and must be easy to view and use on all kinds of mobile phones- be it android or i-phone.</p>

<h2>Five Mobile Friendly features for web designs</h2>
<ol>
<li>The convenience of navigation</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Touch ID</li>
</ol>

<p>The following is a list of five most important mobile-friendly features one must keep in mind while designing a website-</p>
<p><b>1. The convenience of navigation-</b> Earlier, navigation points on the website were kept hidden until it was required by the user. However, today, the scenario has changed. A simple and clear icon layout is all that the customer looks for since it will help him or her to go through the site in lesser time which will enhance the consumer experience.</p>
<p><b>2. Background-</b> All websites have a particular theme which their customers are familiar with. Hence, it is important that the images and backgrounds of the website are either blurred or diffused in order to maintain the familiarity with the users and at the same time, also make the interface mobile friendly.</p>
<p><b>3. Colors-</b> Aesthetics of the website is what the user will first notice, so it has to be attractive and catchy. However, while developing a site for mobile phones, it is important to incorporate enough white spaces since users tend to go through sites more quickly when they are on their mobile phones. Hence, don’t overuse colors but place them wherever necessary.</p>
<p><b>4. Animations-</b> Adding functional animations to websites makes them more interactive, user-friendly and proper usage of good animations can really help users get a more enriched experience with better visualizations and communication.</p>
<p><b>5. Touch ID-</b> This is a new trend. This is basically a technology to ensure security. Many websites, today, are incorporating Touch ID into their design for mobile websites. This will help increase user experience and trust since security is an issue of extreme importance for most cautious customers. This will definitely help them trust your website, and hence they will be able to rely on your services, even when it comes to payments and transactions.</p>
<p>Besides these most important points, it is also necessary to understand that things such as creating an intuitive interface, ensuring wearable technology, good swiping functionality and provision of location services also matters and can affect consumer experience immensely. Also, companies must keep updating their websites to keep up the pace with the latest trends. They must continue creating interesting web interfaces and content for mobile phones as more and more people today have access to phones and use it for the majority of purposes as it offers them both speed and convenience. It is becoming a responsibility for businesses to ensure enhanced consumer experience by making a good website which must be mobile friendly.</p>

      'content' : `<p>User-friendly UX design makes using the software easier and a smoother experience. It follows that having a user-friendly UX design will result in higher profits than from using an unintuitive interface. The distribution and usage of unintuitive software was the norm in enterprise software. This was accepted as the industry standard until the consumerization of enterprise software. With enterprise software becoming a consumer product, competition sprung up, and unintuitive enterprise software was a thing of the past, as company employees could now choose between competing or standard software products just like a customer. Teams had the freedom to choose their software experience from competing offerings.</p>
<p>As a rule, the better the software functions, the better the business functions.<br>
UX design can be implemented by way of two methods, namely, by having an in-house UX design team OR partnering with a <a href="assets/images/ui-design-company-bangalore/">UX design agency</a>. Both these methodologies have their own merits and shortcomings. Let’s explore them, one by one</p>
<p><b>Advantages of having an in-house UX design team</b></p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of having an in-house UX design team, some of the top ones are:</p>
<p><b>Dedicated Team</b>: Having an in-house UX design team gets translated to a team that is fully committed to the process of UX design of your product, from start to finish, including catering to every modification as well as providing the most nuanced solution, as required by the organisation.</p>
<p><b>Domain Knowledge:</b> An in-house UX design team that has been working with the organisation for a number of years will have an in-depth knowledge of the domain of the organisation as well as the software product that they work on.</p>
<p><b>Stakeholders:</b> An in-house UX design team working near stakeholders becomes an integral part of the organisation, hence understanding the value of the project and giving it due attention.</p>
<p><b>Cultural Impact:</b> An in-house UX design team will be impacted by the work culture of the organisation they are working for. This will allow the culture to permeate their design and implementation philosophies, making the product feel more natural and intuitive for the end user of their product.</p>
<p><b>Consistent Experience:</b> Any organisation prefers a consistent user experience across their products. Having an in-house UX design team ensures that the same design philosophies are implemented across a range of the goods, creating a consistent user experience.</p>
<p><b>Flexibility:</b> An in-house UX design team provides flexibility in conception as well as the implementation that allow for customisation of the user experience, suiting the organisation’s requirements.</p>
<p><b>Disadvantages of an in-house UX design team</b></p>
<p><b>Integration:</b> Integrating the UX design team with the rest of the organisation may have adverse effects on the design team, as they may be used to working independently, irrespective of the organisation.</p>
<p><b>Resource Allocation:</b> From hiring to setting up of systems, all tax an organisation’s resources. These include HR issues, optimising the workflow and any other issues that may crop up at any time.</p>
<p><b>Establishing Domain:</b> Once a team is assembled, it is important as well as tedious to establish the team’s domain in the organisation.</p>
<p><b>Cultural Impact:</b> This is a double-edged sword, as the cultural impact an organisation has on the design team may adversely affect the objectivity of the team, as well as disrupt the workflow.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'What is the first thing that you notice when you visit a website?',
      'content' : `<p>What is the first thing that you notice when you visit a website?</p>
<p>Let me guess, its visual appearance, right?</p>
<p>Visual presentation comprises everything from font to the color scheme of the webpage. Colors leverage the power of your text or content. Psychologists have revealed that people have a propensity on a subconscious level to color impressions. Colors have great ability to generate Impact on viewer’s mind, as a result, make the visitors stay longer or shorter. We all know- longer the visitor will stay more the chance to cajole them with the content.</p>
<p>Colors have their own language of emotions that also differs from countries and cultures. Colors are divided into three sections, namely primary, secondary and tertiary colors. Primary colors are the basic colors that cannot be produced by mixing colors, while the secondary color can be formed by mixing primary colors and tertiary colors are formed by mixing secondary colors. Here are some general colors with their general meaning:</p>
<h2>Role of Colors in Designing the Website</h2>
<ol>
<li>Blue, it is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, faith, wisdom, confidence, intelligence and truth.</li>
<li>Black often represents elegance, wealth, sophistication and mystery.</li>
<li>White symbolizes peace, purity and simplicity.</li>
<li>Orange brings a feeling of warmth, enthusiasm or warning.</li>
<li>Red is associated with strength, power, love and desire.</li>
<li>Green can represent nature, life, renewal and energy.</li>
<li>Yellow indicates happiness, freshness, clarity or optimism.</li>
</ol>
<p>But how to use these colors while designing a website? Colors are used in such a way that it triggers the positive consumer emotions. It acts as a non-verbal tool of communication. No formula or concept can help you to choose the right color. Here are some things that we can consider in determining the colors that can positively influence your visitors:</p>
<p>Focus on target audience,<br>
Concentrate on the product,<br>
Background color,<br>
Text should be clearly readable,</p>
<p>Firstly ask yourself, which feeling you want in your audience that will trigger a positive emotion in them towards your product. According to that emotion, select the suitable colors.</p>
<p>The next thing you can do is identify a color that suits your product or that will excite the consumer towards your product. Red associates with high energy or desire, so if you aim to excite the consumer about a product, apply at least some touch of red on your web page. On the hand, blue signifies trust, loyalty or faith, so if you want to cajole the audience with your product, like insurance policies or credit card schemes, then spray some blue on your web page. Black is also a promising color on web pages, it is generally used on art related web pages due to mysterious behavior, in some cases it motivates audience to execute the purchase. Black is also used as font color on majority of websites as it is comfortable to read.</p>
<p>Let’s conclude, colors act as non-verbal binding tool, which imprints the first impression on the audience. So the color combination can play a pivotal role in setting the emotion of the audience. Though it may not completely solve your problem, but if it would have impressed the audience than the audience will be bound to go through the content. This is how colors play a role on webpage, and the rest depends on your content and ability of product.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Nowadays when there are a million websites that cater to the need of the user for any particular piece of information, a system is required to filter and provide the best-suited link. This is achieved by Search Engine Optimisation or SEO. An SEO makes a national or international search to come up with a list of websites by an ascending order of rank. Now it is widely known that site’s popularity or income depends on the number of pings it gets. For this to happen, it is essential for the website to remain higher up in the ranks. And this is achieved by writing SEO friendly content. As with everything, there are ways to make the content better by following certain steps or guidelines. Below are certain aspects that should be kept in mind while writing.</p>

<h2>5 Guidelines for writing SEO friendly content</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use of keywords</li>
<li>Research into the content</li>
<li>Style of writing</li>
<li>Provide links for required information</li>
<li>Review of the article once written</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1. Use of keywords: </strong><br>
Keywords are the instruments that recognize your content in a search. These are the words that are the user’s type in the search engines. Therefore, whenever anyone is writing these keywords should be researched and be mended in the piece. But the interesting thing is that too many keywords put together vaguely will only lead to loss of quality. Hence, the keywords though important should be managed with efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>2. Research into the content:</strong><br>
The content that is displayed on the websites is for both the reader and the search engine. Thus the quality of the content should not falter in any manner whatsoever. It definitely should not be a couple of keywords strung together to form some coherent lines. The content should sufficiently answer all queries that anyone might have regarding the searched issue. For this thorough research has to be done by the person writing it so to include as much information as possible lucidly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Style of writing:</strong><br>
The style of writing is what will keep the interest of a person that opens the website. It should be assumed that a reader has the attention span of a few seconds only. And these few seconds are the only window to impress that particular person. Long, tedious articles should be avoided as much as possible. The paragraphs need to be short and interesting. Bullet points, heading and subheadings can also be used to give more information concisely. In addition to this, it is vital that the content remains juicy and crisp.</p>
<p><strong>4. Provide links for required information:</strong><br>
This facet can gleam from one of the most popular platforms in the world which is Wikipedia. Wikipedia not only provides you with a write-up of the information but also links and sub-links to information wherever possible. This is because you cannot assume a reader to believe everything you say or narrate. Proof should be provided as much as possible to convince the user and give the website a seal of trust.</p>
<p><strong>5. Review of the article once written:</strong><br>
No matter how much proficiency one may have in typing, it is not harmful to give it a read up once. As any typo or any inconvenience for that matter lowers the traffic in a website. It shows a certain degree of incompetence on the part of the writers and the editors. Moreover, it is only logical to spend a few minutes revising the work rather than lose faith with the readers.</p>
<p>If you follow the steps mentioned above, you will get the SEO content that works the best for you.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p>Every User-Experience designer faces a definite problem of creating a typical design for different users. While keeping the needs, expectations, and preferences of the various types of users in mind, the UX designers struggle to design their platforms. They are constantly in the hunt for the common trait among their audiences for creating better design interfaces.</p>
<p>One of the most common dislikes of any user with any background is “They hate advertisements”, especially when they are intensified on a page. The different types include text, video and interactive ads, which come in a pop-up, auto-playing and banners formats. The ads are the revenue generator for mostly non-e-commerce websites and blogs, and hence they use them exhaustively.</p>
<p>It can be clearly seen the advertisements are detrimental for User experience and a challenge for UX designers. There is apparently ‘No way’ that UX designers could abscond to the Advertisement Conundrum. But they believe that if Advertisement count is commensurate with User experience, then it’ll be a successful Interface design.</p>
<p><b>Symbiotic relationship between Ads and UX design</b></p>
<p>In 2000 there were about 361 million people online, and in 2016, 3 billion with the growth rate of 761% and about 0.8 of every mobile user has Internet Subscription. People spend around 3 hours per day online in average making Internet the obvious market, today.</p>
<p>Marketers exploit Display ads, Social media, E-mails and Search engines to market their products and services. Today, one can’t expect returns from Television, Newspapers and yellow page ads because they are outdated. People don’t have time to listen to one-way communications and more often get offended.</p>
<p>Today, Television is replaced by websites like Netflix; Radio is amended by replacing satellite radio commercials, Newspapers with news websites or mobile apps. Even Online marketing faces a threat by many elements like browser plugins (for example, ‘Adblocker’) which thrashes out all the pop-ups and banner ads, thereby enhancing the User experience.</p>
<p>The crux of both the worlds rests on answering the same questions: for whom it is? And what do they value? This implies there should be an understanding between UX designers and advertisers which is the only way to lend some positive results for them and the users; this is the “Symbiotic relationship”.</p>
<p><b>Leading Hands in hand</b></p>
<p>The seemingly possible solution is “Targeted Marketing” which sounds ineffable but is simple that is ‘showing what they want’. Whenever someone searches something on the Internet, it means either they’re looking for it or just collecting information, and if here the marketers impose their ads the users are likely to buy the product or services. It is “intelligent marketing” and wonderful User Experience. ‘Neither all Ads nor website is perfect for everybody’ so it all depends on developing in response to suggestions and feedback.</p>
<p>Today, they are; UX designers and marketers, who they will be tomorrow?</p>
<p>The future of online marketing and UX designing doesn’t seem to be distinct and exhaustive; rather it seems to be a unified one which might be called, say, “creative technologist” or “UX marketers”. It might sound anything but is surely going to demand the professional, the knowledge of online marketing and UX design. Today, the UX and Online marketers could seem incompatible with each other, but if they want success, they have to create the ‘Symbiotic Relationship’ among them and lead together.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p align="justify">A good User Interface (UI) designs are the blend of simplicity, usability, visibility, feedback and reuse principles. The main objective of UI design is to create designs which are user-friendly, accessible and efficient. It’s about anticipation users deep-seated needs and goals and how they will react.

<p align="justify">Be very careful about the shape and size of what you put on your interface. More spacious the clickable icons, the easier it becomes for user-web interactions. The interaction type- scrolling vertically or scrolling horizontally should be carefully handled. It can make the user cranky if the interface is not friendly enough to browse and scroll appropriately and hence the placement of the scroll bars most effectively is imperative.</p>
<p><b>Tradition and Modernity</b></p>
<p align="justify">Innovation and Creativity are highly appreciated. But, don’t sway extremely too far from the traditional methods. A familiar interface with just the right amount of revamping actually improves the overall design. If a save functionality is added to a button with the icon of a ‘printer’, you are right; the interface is never going to fetch you enough customer base.</p>
<p><b>Keep it Simple </b></p>
<p align="justify">Simplicity should be your key all along. It is logical to state, simple things are easy to learn and easy to use. With minimal things for your users to learn and remember, their experience becomes efficient and effective altogether.</p>
<p>In spite of spending a lot of time on building your product, the feedback you hear is “bad user experience”. The reason behind this can be “bad user interface”. It is essential to keep this in mind and take an approach that would aid you in designing better experiences for your user. Although you understand what is actually going wrong, a willful method to make it right is the correct way.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Strolling through the paths of the tech capitals, ever heard the terms of UI design or UX design?',
      'content' : `<p align="justify">Strolling through the paths of the tech capitals, ever heard the terms of UI design or UX design? Here is a quick explanation of what they mean, to answer the queries in your head.</p>
<p>UI stands for User Interface whereas UX refers to User Experience. But, considering UI and UX same is a major technical faux pas.<br>
User Interface would involve a series of screens, icons and buttons that you use to interact with the website/device. User experience is the more technical and analytical field as it is used to gauge internal aspects of experience that a user has while interacting with your product or services.<br>
While the two of them are closely interlinked, the roles they are used for are entirely different. Working with them together becomes a crucial element for the product.<br>
The variation between them lies in the kind of the design discipline. Not only this, but the different parts of processes used can distinguish them from each other. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are two of the most commonly interchanged terms in the technical field. But, both are essential for the success of a product.<br>
In the words of professionals-User Experience is the process of development and improvement of quality interaction between a user and all facets of a company. User Interface refers to the aggregation of approaches and elements that allow the user to interact with a system.<br>
Proper knowledge of the UI and UX terminology is the way to facilitate a better approach taken and a better user experience after that.</p>
<p>It is more likely that the feedback a user forms in the head about the experience at website constitutes the UX. Even if the UI is beyond appreciation, if the functionality has lower standards, then the website is hardly in a position to produce a positive feedback.</p>
<p>In layman terms, you can understand UI as something that deals with what users look at. UX, on the other hand, deals with how and what users feel when interacting in virtual space.<br>
Under the gamut of UX is the flow of how a user proceeds on a website, maybe to subscribe or to sign up. Contrary to that, the UI handles the territory where the visual design for the same journey will be prepared to help the user to browse through the web site and navigate as and when required owing to his/her will.</p>
<p>The people or the designers who have hands-on industry experience in this field have different mindsets when working with UI or UX. Their line of thought, perceptions and execution strategies are different from each other yet linked in some or the other way. There is much more than what meets the eye whenever UI and UX are taken together into consideration. The UX ensures a user has an eventful and smooth browsing experience with an expanded knowledge of what the website is trying to convey whereas UI supports UX to cater to the navigation needs of the user.</p>
<p>Hence, the output of both processes is extremely varied. As they are distinguished fields, the skill-set required in both also differs considerably.</p>`,

You can spend all the effort and time in the world writing excellent content on your website, but they are never going to locate you if you do not use the language of your audience.</p>
<p align="justify">Keyword study is a means to learn more about your audience, how they think, and what they care about, so that you may align it with the content on your website. You ought to be capable of getting started doing keyword study on your site and approach the procedure as an easy method to create an alliance between the way you talk about your company and the way your clients talk about it. Since you can find such a wide variety of variables to consider determining which keywords to target for a page may be tricky.</p>
<p align="justify">The initial step is finding out what language your market is using to talk about your merchandise. Being in first place assists a great deal, but Click-through rate may also be useful as an index of how well you’re content fits up with the user’s question and that term. It is an indicator that individuals were not finding a better answer to their question farther upward on the page if your position is comparatively small, but CTR is still high. With a few tweaking, these queries might be a chance to improve exposure and rankings since you are replying the question better than sites in places ahead of you. You rank for, and another set that you want to work toward once you have an enormous list of essential phrases, the next thing is to break the keywords list down by subject. From the list you have compiled there are typically several different topics and subtopics that emerge.</p>
<p align="justify">Group Picks Several Key Terms to Goal and Key Words by Subject. To start, arrange these keywords by the topic after which select several head terms that you need to prioritize for each subject. The number of keywords you should depends on your resources, how important or big your website is, etc. Then pick a few head terms that are closely associated to target with each page. Select two or one high quantity, conditions that are competitive that you want to see improve and already rank well for. Join these head terms that are perfect with a few terms that are less competitive you may quickly optimize for.</p>

Not only can it be important to select the subjects that are right to hit, but it is also important to choose those issues to be covered by the right pages.</p>
<p align="justify">Stick to two or one strongly associated subjects per page. Keep in mind that may still mean you target multiple keywords per page that come under one theme. It is not much harder to optimize a page for one subject than for three. Contain both less competitive and competitive conditions in your strategy understanding that the more aggressive a term is, the more work you are going to have to do to earn a place on page one. Getting traffic that is combined with several conditions that are less competitive can add up to conversions as well as more and the same amount of traffic. The most valuable takeaway from keyword research that is successful should be a better comprehension of how your website does or does not meet your audience needs and what your audience needs are. Your aim should be to create content that is helpful and exciting to your market.</p>`,

      'content' : `<p><b>Target clientele and their behaviors </b></p>
<p>Now your information savvy clients in Bangalore are more dependent on online today over your preferred failing traditional mediums and methods. They gauge on many parameters to trust the builder to make a purchase decision. Isn’t it wise to reach your client through the devices which they carry all the time. Rather than selling your property through a traditional marketing approach, why don’t we try to make your client understand how important it is to buy our property which adds a number of values to his decision over both long and short time.</p>
<p><b>Cost Benefits</b></p>
<p>Traditional marketing like Newspaper and TVC’s price quotient is unrealistic today with their claimed but much doubted TRP ratings. More over the first page advert is allocated to you only when you buy a yearly package of ad space with the same medium. With online marketing your brands budget is spend accurately to your potential client to acquire or to make an impression to the brand awareness by targeting them based on their geography, age-group, interests and also the job profile. The fraction of cost you spent on the digital medium will <i>trigger your end client to act upon the call-to-action functions</i>. Bottom line is you will end up spending much more than acquire a client or his mindshare through traditional marketing methodologies instead of doing it online.</p>
<p><b>Digital Marketing for real estate is more of emotional branding</b></p>
<p>Digital marketing is not just glorify how amazing your property &amp; real estate is, but also to tell your potential client how we answer his aspirations and dreams that he is emotionally connected to. Since real estate is being a high ticket value product, we realize that the client takes a longer time to make a decision to buy. So your branding and communication will be part of the<i> journey to customer development process</i>. The process will be backed with consistent digital marketing and social media activities and will take some time to reap the benefits.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Being a marketer for past 3 years, I have closely served 150 brands in both, India and UAE. In the past whenever I came across the term "Growth Hacking",',
      'content' : `<p>Being a marketer for past 3 years, I have closely served 150 brands in both, India and UAE. In the past whenever I came across the term “Growth Hacking”, I have always felt that it was a western version of our Indian slang terminology- ‘Being Jugaad’ and my thoughts on it were that it was okay for a start-up company to find some out-of-the-box methods to grow faster across sales, operations, human resources or even customer satisfaction. It has worked for few in the past but for some, it may not work at all. As the director of <a href="assets/images/">www.brandstory.in</a> I now consult some of the largest brands who have dominated their respective verticals over decades and have introduced new stars (BCG Matrix) in their product portfolio, which needed some immediate attention. Many challenges come into the picture when the management wants to adapt growth hacking towards their stars. Let’s see how we can implement growth hacking in the corporate structure by overcoming certain challenges.</p>
<p><b>Attitude</b></p>
<p>Let’s be honest here. For some, growth is a wish, for others it’s a plan and very few plan and work hard(er) for the phenomenon called growth. We may have many perspectives outside but mostly it depends on the core expertise of the deliverer which can be coding, marketing, analytics or even execution.</p>
<p>It is easy for a startup to adapt growth hacking since there is no definite pressure to achieve a definite number through an activity. Usually, startup’s adapt growth hacking with the mindset of “Become Big or Die Hard”. So it’s easy to list out 20 odd ways to promote the business and get benefited from that one activity to gets things right.</p>
<p>So the question is do the corporate heavy-weights have a growth hacking mindset? Can they prepare a team to work hard in order to get results and then prepare that team to be willing to fail frequently?</p>
<p>Will a corporate accept to work hard with experimental activities and indefinite time frames based completely out of the usual “insights and stats” scope?</p>
<p>Because that’s what growth hacking is! If your corporate hierarchy, doesn’t let you fail quick and small, you are missing the most important component of growth hacking.</p>
<p><b>Agile</b></p>
<p>Within corporates, strategic planning and management are present in the system to assess the current internal and external factors, where you ideate and formulate a high-level strategy to get them executed flawlessly.</span></p>
<p>Then you reevaluate and refine the ongoing strategy. Growth Hacking works on Agile. Period.</p>
<p>Agile gives you the flexibility of frequent adaptation to dynamic business circumstances. People with different skill sets and their frequent interactions are crucial above the business processes. With very limited planning agile helps you to get start with the project.</p>
<p><b>Activity</b></p>
<p>So Attitude and Agile can be sorted by the few management and innovation enthusiasts in the corporate system but that doesn’t exactly prove that the existing rating systems will help to rate a growth hacking enthusiast/team in the company.</p>
<p>A corporate system appreciates an employee only through the quantity of results he can provide whereas most of the growth hacking activities may not bring in any immediate results to the key business objectives.</p>
<p>Because in reality, we can measure a growth hacker only by the number of activity (+ sub activities) done, with the frequency of the activity against the time period given to drive the growth metrics. That transforms to (Activities+Frequency) / Time Period.</p>
<p><b>Analyze</b></p>
<p>Measure every single growth hacking activity and its impact, so you can optimize quickly as and how every activity demands. Add or Remove tools to have the impact you desire. There is a list of tracking tools for product management, project management, acquisition, sales and retention. Have them in a loop to monitor, optimize, experiment and to analyze, so you can activate a better process with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Definitely growth hacking, isn’t a rocket science. Just these 4A’s should be fun experimenting! It certainly was fun adopting these and hacking all the way.</p>`,

<p>The best of the startups have come into existence when the founders themselves faced some problem and tried the derive a solution for the same. These startups have incepted from the idea of creating opportunities for themselves by creating solutions to their pain points. Then you need to justify the value created by that solution.Who wants this right now? Who else is facing the same problems as you? What is the extent of their need for your offering? Will they use something that is just a shallow version, merely fulfilling the minimum viability of the offering made by a two-person startup from unknown parts of the hemisphere?

<p><b>Scope out your industry: Do an intensive market research</b></p>

A general demographic isn’t enough, so you must direct your efforts to hone in your targeted buyer personas. Identify and brainstorm micro markets that you want your product or service to prevail in.

In other words, this allows you to understand and manage the specific needs and interests within the micro markets and identify the typical background of the <i>ideal </i>buyer for your product. After all you must know what makes your customers tick!</p>
<p><b>Branding your business: Name, Logo and Presence</b></p>
<p>Choosing the right name for your business is vital and you need to think long and hard before coming down to that final call. Make sure that it doesn’t confuse with any existing brand name in the market which can lead to loss of sales and also complicate into legal actions. Also check for the availability of web domain which is more or less in line with the company name because that is the first thing your target audience sees. Get a professional logo designed which is a crucial decision if you are serious about developing your business in future. A unique look creates an impression across prospective customers and gives them confidence regarding your offerings and marks as your Brand identity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Create a business plan</b></p>
<p>You would not build a house without a blueprint. Similarly, you should not start any venture without a well-designed business plan. A well planned business model serves many purposes. It not only acts as a means to introduce your business to banks or investors for loans and funding purposes but also provides a clear direction for the business. A business plan also counts in contingency plans in case of unexpected events. The business plans lists out all the pros and cons of doing a business and if the pros outweighs the cons, then your business plan is good to go. A professional and well-crafted business plan has a step-by-step work process right from the executive summary to the financial forecasting, which covers as the most essential aspect of securing investment.</p>
<p><b>Do you have access to all resources to launch your business?</b></p>
<p>You need not be a richie rich to start a business. It all depends on your idea. How substantial or unique is your idea? If not unique, then how exactly are you different from the other players in the market? There needs to be some kind of special element in your offering that drives people to favor you over your competitors. It may be anything: Your product in general, the customer experience you offer, sales support, pricing and offers or anything that the customer finds exclusively from you. And to translate this USP to the customers you need combination time, money and smartness. Marketing of a product or service starts right from the inception of the idea for the offering and you need to make sure that you have all the necessary ingredients to deliver what you promise. Unless and until you are absolutely sure about what you have to offer, wait out before entering the market. There are many aspects to look into like looking into all the legality related issues of licensing and other contractual agreements. Getting permit for sales and services, agreement with suppliers and distributors in case of products business. You should ensure that all the processes right from sales to supplier agreements are all legal binding and contracted up with relevant terms and conditions. Partnering up with businesses is also a choice to facilitate resources and it also helps in tapping into an existing customer base of loyalists. In all, it is about getting the best out of the least to deliver the best to the customers.</p>
<p><b>Strategizing a marketing plan for your brand</b></p>
<p>What is the point of having a business if nobody knows about it? If you plan on building over an idea right from ground-up, you are most likely to plan an effective marketing strategy that accompanies your offerings. If you don’t then all the value proposition and benefits are overshadowed by the lack of visibility and reach across your prospective customers. Both digital as well as traditional marketing is essential to reach out to the right set of audience for your products or services. Digital footprint is essential for all forms of business. If one can’t find you online, it’s as if you don’t really exist. Even if you don’t sell over online or e-commerce platform, it is still paramount to have an online presence via websites, social and other forums to create visibility of your products or services. You need not be a marketing whiz or start with a big marketing budget, all you need is to start small and focus on building relationships to get your name out there. The key to successful marketing is to understand the customer value of your business, reflect upon your brand image and capitalize over your point of difference across the market. It is all about building a reputation for yourself as well as your business in the market.</p>`,

      'overview' : 'Claim your name : The 1st step is to claim a name for your business. More often than not, the names you choose for your business has already been copyrighted by existing big brands and savvy corporations.',
      'content' : `<ol><li ><b>Claim your name</b><br>
The 1st step is to claim a name for your business. More often than not, the names you choose for your business has already been copyrighted by existing big brands and savvy corporations. The lack of a relevant domain name for your business website may severely harm your digital credit and you need to be agile to grab the best before somebody snatches the URLs. This helps extensively to gain control of a brand or trademark. Whether you are claiming a particular username on Facebook or choosing a Twitter/Instagram handle or registering a domain name, it needs to be a progressively worked out plan to stake out your territory across your digital assets.</li>
<li ><b>Build your website</b><br>
You have your name, you have your domain, you have your business plan ready, now it’s time to build your website. You need a website to showcase your brand across the digital space. Your business website is like a piece of real estate which corresponds all accesses in the digital infrastructure of the business. Getting a unique URL is just the beginning, what follows is construction of a website that clearly projects the vision and mission of the company and is highly optimized at the same time. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the key to enhance the visibility of your website by increasing your Search engine ranking across search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. Unlike traditional SEO, modern SEO focuses on optimizing websites for the users rather than search engines. 5 key elements of optimizing a website are:
<ol>
<li >URL Structure<br>
The URL of a web page is the web address used by the users to access your web content over the internet. URL structure refers the assembly of text in the URL and how each URL associated with the website react among one another. Some relevant aspects to optimize URL structure are:
<ul>
<li >URL must contain the focus keyword</span></li>
<li >Separate individual keywords with dashes for the internal page URLs</li>
<li >Use 301 redirect errors in case of permanent redirect for site maintenance issues prolonging more than a day. Google prefers 301 error instead of giving credit to multiple versions of the same web content and URL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li >Page title<br>
Title of the page is what you see at the Tab of the browser window when you visit a webpage. SEO optimized page titles must adhere to the following guidelines:<br>
– Include focus keyword in the title<br>
– Title must be more than 35 characters but less than 65 characters.<br>
– Add company name at the end of the title<br>
– Add unique page title for each page within the website</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li >Meta Description</li>
<li>This contains a short summary of the content of a particular web-page and must contain the focus keyword of that web page. </li>
<li >Headings<br>
The heading must be relevant to the keyword across a particular webpage so it is suggested to use only one &lt;h1&gt; tag as the focus keyword of that page. In case of a text-heavy blog posts, it is advisable to add a few &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; tags as paragraph titles.</li>
<li >Images<br>
Images add as a catalyst to enhance user experience on a website. But excessive images can slow down the loading of a page, so one should add only relevant images and also associate keyword specific filename and add keyword specific alt tag for descriptions to enhance SEO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Getting an optimized website reflects well across the search engine and is accepted by the users as it inspires confidence in your brand. So, get a unique domain name for the URL and build a website around it and optimize it so that it stands tall on its own.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content development</b><br>
You have built an optimized website, the next step is to develop unique and creative content. 'Content is the king' is an overused cliche but stand true for an effective internet marketing strategy. Unless and until you engage your target audience, you cannot reach out to the customers (or potential customers), and developing strong and engaging content is the way to achieve popularity across digital space. Whether it be an infographic content or an informative blog associated to your website, a well written high quality can not only drive visitors to your website but cater to a specific targeted crowd who are most likely to be converted into leads. Blogging is a dynamic way of injecting strong content over the websites and also helps ranking higher in Search engine ratings. Blogging is focussed approach as a magazine or a journal writer rather than a marketing manager or a business owner. It has a customer centric approach from the point of view of a regular individual which is essential to connect with the right set of audience. Any content across a blog must serve the purpose of educating or entertaining the potential customers rather than pushing your products or services across them. Blog isn’t the only content effective to generate traffic and further leads. Other contents like e-books, research reports and whitepapers can also be used to generate leads for the business. There are other non-text contents too like how-to videos, presentations, webinars etc. that together help businesses to contact, interact, connect, reconnect, convince and finally convert into customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Social Presence</b><br>
It is not enough anymore to just have a website for your business across the digital space. Your digital storefront extends to social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, though Linked is more of a professional network than a social like others. Social media presence has become eminent considering the huge scope of directly communicating with your target audience and learning about their interests which can serve to better deliver your products and services in your target market. Social media acts as an effective interface between the company, the employees and the customers is an ever evolving medium of self sustaining growth across the digital space. While there is a wide array of social networks across the digital space but the main focus is on the “big three”: Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. If you don’t own a Twitter account or a Facebook page for the company, it’s time to get on with the program and bring yourself up to speed. Having a LinkedIn company page is a major asset asset for marketing your company across business professional and find interested parties to gain keen insights and add value to your company’s digital credit. Social media is a key driver of your brand’s online presence and facilitates targeted content distribution. So, once you are done with your website integrate it with social media networks and start capitalizing on it for gaining competitive advantage across digital arena.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Get listed in directories</b><br>Apart from websites and social media platforms, it is important to register yourself in directory sites as well. Some common examples are Yahoo Local, Yelp, Just Dial but it is more likely that you must have a dedicated directory for your specific business. Start with listing yourself in the popular directories across broader categories. And then look out for specific ones and register your company and website there too. Make sure that you develop a complete profile and not just your basic contact info. Having a complete profile inspires confidence among the audience who are looking out for your products and services and creates a positive brand perception. Include all business details like Company name, logo, contact info with designated person and other relevant pieces of information as per the directory site requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Creating Buyer Persona Groups</b><b><br>
</b>Once you get your digital existence across website and social media platforms up and running, it comes down to converting your audience into leads. The increased traffic to your site derived from all the above activities isn’t generating any business. You see many new visitors coming to your site but these visits aren’t transforming into new customers. So, it is time to do some Inbound Marketing which is the best way to convert visitors into potential leads. You need to create a Buyer persona profile which enlists targeted individuals based on their specific interests. This allows you tailor your content right from words of messaging to your complete marketing campaign as per their specific needs, behaviors, and concerns across different persona groups. In other words, this allows you to understand and manage the specific needs and interests within the micro markets and identify the typical background of the </span><i>ideal </i>buyer for your product. You need to regularly update your credentials and add more and more information about what you have to offer to drive interest from your target audience. Then you need to identify each buyer persona group and direct your marketing campaign exclusively to meet their specific expectations. This hones up to higher rate of acceptance by the potential customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Creating a Call to Action</b><b><br>
</b>Adding a strong call to action is very important to get targeted insight of the customers or potential customers visiting your website. First, you need to identify what your online visitors want to do when they visit your website and then encourage them to do so through an effective Call to Action. Your call to action needs to convince the visitors to take some kind of action no matter how small it is. Adding CTAs for “Subscription to company’s newsletter” or “Connecting to a company phone number” and many other CTAs can help capture attention of the visitors in an incredibly brief window to avoid bounce from the website. While designing a Call To Action, you need to follow two main principles: Visibility and Clarity of the message. There are multiple elements that can be added both focussed on these two principles but you need to decide the best one and not overcrowd the CTA. When choosing the best alternative or collection of elements it is better to conduct an A/B testing to get a definitive prove for the best CTA. It may sound like a lot of extra effort, but the resulting improved action rates and overall website performance makes it worth the effort. Once you define the most appropriate call(s) to action for your business, add them throughout your site so people see them often and easily. If you’re committed enough to actually boost your rate of conversion across digital space, it is very important to write a compelling Call to Action. </li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Manage your online reputation</b><b><br>
</b>Monitoring your reputation over the digital space is also an essential part of sustaining the perfect space across the internet. It is not like Facebook that gives you just a Like button and no Dislike button. A single negative comment or review can defame your reputation and lead to subsequent loss of valuable audience. Your digital presence needs to be consistently monitored and scrutinized to showcase the best version of your business to your audience. Online reputation management includes the following activities:</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Monitor your reputation by keeping a track of the reviews and ratings. Your ratings and reviews directly impact your online reputation and you need to immediately act on them to suppress the negatives if any.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Managing the reviews is also an important task. Feedback is very necessary for optimizing your online presence and these feedbacks (positive ones) act as means to gain visibility and positive fame across the the digital space which encourages and builds trust among other members of your target audience.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Handling a damage repair scenario is one of the most difficult aspects of ORM. Bad PR, negative comments etc needs to be reviewed from time to time and these individuals need to be addressed by providing them with the best possible solutions. It is like grievance handling where you counter act to prevent any damage to the company’s name.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Highlight positive reviews and ratings. Helpful reviews that highlight company’s brand value and ratings (4 and above) showcase the success of your business in providing adequate solution to your customers whether it be products or services. These reviews must be amplified across social media and other digital spaces.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Make a budget plan</b><br>
Budgeting is a very vital part of designing a complete business plan while capturing your online presence. Any digital marketing campaign requires a structured plan to act upon and is developed keeping in mind about the resources, spendings and availability of the access across the digital space. The ROI associated with digital marketing is easily quantifiable. One needs to count in all the essentials associated with the campaign and not just the primary factor i.e. Building a website. Building a website for the company is just the start of an overall digital marketing campaign, there are other expenses too that are associated with PPC Ad Campaigns, Content marketing campaign, SEO, Social media marketing and many more. All these are essential “drivers” to claim the best possible space across digital arena and should not be ignored while deciding on the budget expenditure for digital marketing. <br>
<br>
And if you want the best results, you need to invest accordingly. The key strategy as part of the primary objective may not include a budget for everything, but as you progress you need to spend more to get more.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Get your Analytics and Testing Strategy in Place</b><br>
With frequent updating algorithms of SEO and ever increasing platforms for Social media activity, there is a dire need to have a proper analytic structure in place to measure your activities across the digital space. One cannot directly jump into the the digital arena with contents without analyzing the efficacy of it. No matter how strong you may think your offering is, there are millions of individuals and companies who may be targeting the same space as you. You need to test your offering before you actually showcase it over any digital platform. It is a challenge to prioritize your target area where you want to penetrate to get your desired audience and you need to determine the best channels for you as quickly as possible based on the metrics that justify as per your marketing strategy.<br>
<br>
Analytics is very critical and complex and you cannot master it overnight. You need to carefully hone your skills as analyst by analysing all the quirks associated with &nbsp;specific channels using multiple tools to collect data and then set up the complete digital marketing infrastructure for a successful digital campaign.</li>

      'content' : `<p>With the market share of almost 2 percent and 7 percent population penetration, e-commerce industry is the future of sales and service. Every successful industry is keen on exploring the immense opportunity and increase their digital presence to capture the maximum share of the market. The success stories of Indian e-commerce is known to every individual, but often people forget to notice the failure of the industry.</p>
<p>Success is an outcome of careful planning and strategic execution of the business model. With a mad race in the e-commerce businesses that are looking forward to explore the opportunity and mark their presence on the online platform should incorporate a very comprehensive list of activates to assure success. The prime area of attention for an e-commerce industry are:</p>
<ol>
<li>E-Commerce is the new traditional marketing</li>
<li>Understanding the need of time</li>
<li>The right business model</li>
<li>Delivering values not just product or service</li>
<li>Targeting the appropriate customer segment</li>
<li>Easy process</li>
<li>Customer is always right</li>
<li>Maintaining &nbsp;your reputation</li>
<li>Evolve with the needs of time and customer</li>
</ol>
<p><b>E-commerce is the new traditional marketing:</b></p>
<p>In the age of millennials, everyone is in a hurry, hurry to reach the height in the least span of time. E-Commerce is the solution to all their needs, saving their precious time. In this era people are getting more comfortable when a product or service is delivered at their doorstep at their suitable time than spending hours browsing on the street or store bearing the heat of traffic while commuting.</p>
<p>E-Commerce industry need to the adapt to their customer and instead of treating itself as an exclusive solution, it needs to accept the reality of time and invest its resources even more than traditional marketer to educate the people about the advantages and explain them their own needs of time. E-Commerce industry is now not just a hobby but a very competitive industry.</p>
<p><b>Understanding the need of time</b>:</p>
<p>Before even starting the business, every company needs to introspect about the product or service they are planning to deliver. Ask yourself the difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do customers need this?</li>
<li>Are there better solutions already available in the market?</li>
<li>What values are we giving to the customer?</li>
<li>Are we entering late or early to the market?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a very tough decisions and all these parameters needs to be carefully understood and examined to assure that the idea is viable and growth is evident. The success can only be evaluated over the period of time, but if it delivers values and needs to the customers, success will follow.</p>
<p><b>The right business model:</b></p>
<p>You might have the next big idea, but a careless, unplanned and unexplored outcome in a business model can be the sole cause of your business failure. The idea needs to be tested over and over again. The structure should be well laid and the revenue should be carefully studied, after all it’s all about the profits one makes from the business. Generating revenue is not only the need for self but also for the business, a business in loss cannot function forever.</p>
<p><b>Delivering values not just product or service</b></p>
<p>Building an emotional connect with the audience and customer is very important. The logo, tagline, mission and vision of the business should be designed keeping in view the customer and employees of the company. When purchasing from you company the customer should feel associated with the company and a strong feeling of belief should lead the transaction. One of the important key factor affecting this is the employees of the company, a highly motivated employee force spread the message “the company cares for you”.</p>
<p>Customer not only buy your product or service but engage to build a strong long term connection. Get emotionally connected and make their every purchase a life changing experience for them.</p>
<p>Remember there are who are ready to offer them what you have, create a point of differentiation for a better customer satisfaction.</p>
<p><b>Targeting the appropriate customer segment:</b></p>
<p>Every product or service does not interest everyone, every individual has different needs. Every e-commerce industry needs to carefully evaluate their target segment. Every segment of the society is present online, you product or service might not be the need of all. The company resource should not be invested on the segment that are not potential target or even a close lead for the business. Every advertisement should capture specific audience and deliver the message bold and strong.</p>
<p>Careful and creative advertisement placement and highly targeted approach should be followed to gain the maximum of the available resource. Hitting blind targets might be successful a few time but not in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Easy Process</b></p>
<p>Always remember you are there for the customer satisfaction and happiness, you are not an interrogator. Keep the information flow simple and highly precise, customer need only what they want or what they are offered. The overall process that is right from the visit to final checkout should be systematic and easy to understand. One must not ask for irrelevant or highly personalised information. The traction process epically should be very quick and easy to use.</p>
<p><b>Customer is always right</b></p>
<p>In a customer driven industry, there is only one mantra “customer is always right”. Every customer complaint or suggestion should be of high priority. Every mistake that the company incur only adds to the vicious cycle of bad reputation.</p>
<p>At the end of the day customer satisfaction should be the priority of the company, even if in the process the company incurs a few loss but at the same time it should ensure that the goodwill of the company should not be taken for granted and exploited.</p>
<p>Do plan occasional surprise for your loyal customers and reach to the people who seek advice.</p>
<p><b>Maintaining your reputation</b></p>
<p>The trust in a company only prevails if the customer get regular positive response and feedback. The company should regularly engage on social media platform to understand what their customer feel about the services and products offered. While engaging on the social media the responses should be personified rather than leaving an impression that a corporate is interacting with the audience. Keep it as human as possible.</p>
<p>Customers’ queries should be adequately answered and a little humour with wittiness is always welcomed by the customer. The achievements of the company should be marketed with uttermost preciseness, and should look as the achievements of the customer rather than company boosting about itself also popular customer responses and companies special activities should be promoted on the social media.</p>
<p><b>Evolve with the needs of time and customer</b></p>
<p>The needs of the customers are endless, even they don’t know what they need unless they are offered. As a business one should keep evolving and testing new products and services that change the life of the customer or make their life easy. Also it is very important to address the immediate need of the customers and ensure the activities or process that are highly rejected by the customers are simplified as per customer needs.</p>
<p>Keep experimenting and keep adapting to the changing needs of the customer to be the next big success. <br>

      'overview' : 'Engage. Engage. Engage. Do not try to endorse your product or services in your digital marketing content. Always write things that will engage your end clientele.',
      'content' : `<p><strong>Be a Publisher but not an Marketer.</strong></p>
<p>Engage. Engage. Engage. Do not try to endorse your product or services in your digital marketing content. Always write things that will engage your end clientele. Rather than addressing benefits of your products and services, tell them what is their pain points which have to be addressed and how you have solutions for same. Forget your sales target while you writing a blog / article. Tell them that how you are here&nbsp;to help them but do not chase them to sell. Add value so they can believe that you are the best one to trust. So your social media content is consumable rather than in edible.</p>
<p><strong>Be authentic.</strong></p>
<p>Let the blogs or articles be a replica of yourself. Make sure&nbsp;that your clients get the tone, personality of your brand, culture, belief through your writing. Even if you get your writings through an external agency like us, ensure that the substance is replica of your own soul. Never give an image to your client of something you are not. So your online reputation will be the true mirror of your practices. Write your own content from your experiences. Authenticate the usability of the product and services through your own experiences. Write things and publish in your social media channel such as why you are in the business and what drives you to be excellent in providing solution in your chosen field. Let them know the passion for your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Give your best.</strong></p>
<p>Everybody knows content plays an important role in nurturing a brand’s credibility online. This credibility is built over consistent postings of blogs and articles through your social media agency or the digital marketing companies you hire. To keep up consistency many brands write articles which are not at their&nbsp;best. If you believe in the concept something is better than nothing,<em>oops!</em>Not really. You are risking the credibility of your clients and followers by posting not quality work. Give them something which is valuable, which they can take them free to continue following and admiring you.</p>

      'content' : `<p>Its not surprising to look at young CEOs and VPs, who have had barely a few years of experience with large corporations, deciding to start their own companies.</p>
<p>Few years back, starting a company of your own might have sounded ambitious for many, and impossible for the youngsters who came out of a middle class background.</p>
<p>Gone are those days! The corporate culture is now changing and it can be seen in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. It is undeniable that the startup ecosystem in Bengaluru has attracted enterprising, and progressive minds from every nook, and corner of the country.</p>
<p>Coworking spaces in Bangalore offer a comfortable nest for migrating entrepreneurs and add them to the warmth of Bangalore’s startup community.</p>
<p>Before an entrepreneur decides to pursue his journey in entrepreneurship, all he needs is a friend’s place to stay and use as his office address.</p>
<p>A young entrepreneur, Mr. Vivek, moved into Bangalore&nbsp;with an obsession on UI very recently. He works out of BHiVE Workspace at Koramangala and he says that, “Working out of a coworking space is great advantage for a new entrepreneur. I find an investment banker, a coding marvel, an exceptional operation guy and a digital marketing girl, all in one single table!”.</p>
<p>He also mentions that, “to recruit and build a team of this stature will take too much of time and an enormous monetary investment. Now, we discuss and get to know in detail about each other’s expertise. The learning in such a place is huge and all of this happens only due to amazing coworking culture in Bangalore”.</p>
<p>With multiple coworking options in Bangalore, very few add value for money with outstanding facilities offered like plug and play spaces, meeting rooms, training rooms and exclusive office room on daily, monthly and yearly packages.</p>
<p>Another entrepreneur, Mr.Kumar, a veteran startup investor states that, “the success of startup lies in how fast they can grow in their first year. To accomplish a faster growth, the team needs to focus on bringing in more business to the company rather than worrying about the internet, the housekeeping, commercial space, etc. With Bangalore&nbsp;providing various option of coworking spaces, it is very easy to nurture the dream of building a business faster. And with a coworking space like BHiVE, which gives me access to their multiple locations, it helps entrepreneurs to move and work with in the city at their comfort”.</p>
<p>With excellent services and community perks, the leading coworking spaces in Bangalore&nbsp;is given an edge to the success for the entrepreneurs and allows them to make their dream a reality.</p>
<p>With startup events and meetups, BHiVE Workspace welcome entrepreneurs to network, collaborate and create. Very few coworking spaces, like BHiVE, are capable of bridging the gap between VCs and angel funding to startups that work based in their own coworking spaces.</p>
<p>Bangalore&nbsp;being the coworking destination of India, spaces like BHiVE add value and help shape vision of thousands of entrepreneurs in the city.</p>

          'title':'Barriers for Rebranding',

          'content' : `<p>There are lots of challenges and malfunctions organizations can run into when determining to rebrand. But what are a number of the areas that are more common to be alert to? Here's what you need to know:-</p>
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Missing research</h2>
          <p>The world is going at a fast speed, and the perspectives and perceptions your customers held last year might not be useful this year. Marking down research that is solid at the beginning of your rebranding journey means you will make conclusions without having penetrations to hand and all the directing tactical information.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not employing the right key stakeholders</h2>
          <p>It's crucial to have the right stakeholders if they are to buy into the brand journey. Supplying Sales or the Board a chance to give will ensure a simpler path to the internal adoption of the brand. On the flipside, there is a fine line between becoming overwhelmed with feedback from all the areas of one's company and engaging your key stakeholders.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Enabling personal choices to get in the way</h2>
          <p>We're all passionate about our own brands, however, it's important to stay objective when transferring throughout the rebranding process. Stay objective about taglines and possible proposals and don't bring personal tastes when developing the visual identity.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Thinking as a campaign of your brand</h2>
          <p>Taking on a campaign-only state of mind might lead to dynamic, catchy taglines yet it doesn't empower the building of brand equity that will survive beyond the latest marketing tendencies. When going throughout the rebranding procedure, it's important to remember that this is over just a launch campaign. Your brand is the directing force behind every bit of promotion you do.</p>
           
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Breaking your own rules </h2>
          <p>Breaking brand guidelines as soon as you have them immediately fractures the visual basis you're building. How may you anticipate your internal teams and external providers to follow the guidelines if you don't? It's important to keep visual expression consistent for maximum impact in your marketplace.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Underestimating the internal transformation attempt</h2>
          <p>It may be tempting to simply roll out your brand across the old parts, but what needs to be updated and what needs to be retired? What new assets do you want that you don't presently have? And it's not only advertising assets: your brand covers sponsorships, company records, presentations, IT, recruiting and internal use. The risk is in underestimating this attempt. Setting together a stakeholder group that is working should ensure your rebrand covers the demands of your organization.</p>
           
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not briefing external providers completely</h2>
          <p>External providers can bring your brand to life via security that is owed; whether it includes video or signage content. Creating a comprehensive briefing session between your service and any design nuances will be prevented by your external providers from becoming lost in the transformation.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not taking stock</h2>
          <p>Neglecting to monitor the reaction and the influence your brand is having continuingly will mean you miss a chance to refine and improve incrementally. This step-by-step progress will save you from having to undertake a costly overhaul farther down the path, and you will be kept by the continuing assessment of your brand on top of what the market expects out of your brand.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 18px">Not spending some time to nurture and to care</h2>
          <p>Your brand needs continuous care and consideration. Continue to embed the brand worth in your team, look for means to grow, improve your brand reach, and continue to work with providers which are invested in your brand's success.

          'title':'All you need to know about Personal Branding',
          'overview' : 'By creating an identity that becomes linked with specific understandings and feelings at its core, a brand is about affecting others. But branding is not only for businesses any more.',
          'content' : `<p>By creating an identity that becomes linked with specific understandings and feelings at its core, a brand is about affecting others. But branding is not only for businesses any more. There's a growing tendency called Personal Branding that we believed could be intriguing to investigate. Successful Personal Branding entails handling understandings efficiently, and controlling and affecting how others think and perceive of you. Having a powerful Private Brand in the current on-line individual and virtual age is significant.</p>
 
          <p>Where to start? Well, you can determine the features that mark you as distinguishing from co-workers and rivals. What have you done lately to make you stick out? What would your opponents or co-workers record as your clearest and finest strength? What's your clearest private characteristic? Work on what you do that's identifying, quantifiable, distinguishable and of remarkable value. Work out what you are most proud of attaining. To truly become a brand, you will need to focus on these places that add value, that you may take credit for, and that you are proud of. You might be a brand; you have got a brand; it is now about placing you against your market.</p>
          
          <h2>Placing Yourself as a Brand</h2>
          
          <p>What's promising about this strategy is that it gives the chance to stick out, learn, improve and develop their abilities to everyone. Everybody can be a brand worthy of significant attention. There are various strategies to the notion of Personal Branding. A number of people define personal placing by concentrating on picture building, selling, packaging, external appearance, self-promotion, branding from a marketing standpoint, and becoming well-known. This could become an ego trip, and you might be perceived as egocentric and self-centered. This strategy will only take you thus far: Personal Branding advertising and is way more than promoting yourself.</p>
           
          <h2>Credibility </h2>
          <p>A more real strategy pressures you into making your Private Brand authentically and genuine Personal Branding is a journey towards a more successful and happier life. Therefore, your Private Brand needs to be bona fide. It should emerge out of your search for identification and meaning in life, and it is about developing yourself constantly, holding it in your mind, giving it all of your positive energy, and making quite clear what you need. Your Private Brand needs to be based on your values, strengths, singularity and brilliance and should represent your true nature. If you really can brand yourself in this natural manner, in that case, your brand will be precious to others, clear, and convincing. You will bring opportunities and the people that suit you. </p>
          
          <h2>Focus </h2>
          <p>Whatever happens, you need to quantify brand against four things today. You have to be a supportive co-worker and an excellent team player. You have got to be an extraordinary pro at something which has real value. Thirdly you'll need to be a comprehensive visionary - a leader, tutor, and an imaginer. Finally, you'll need to be closely focused on the consequences that are practical.</p>`,

          'content' : `<p>In advertising, it appears like the word brand is employed a great deal: the top brand, private brand, off-brand. But there is frequently confusion around its significance in operation. What does it entail? Do I need to employ a professional? Branding is pricey, right? To that last stage, it does not have to be. As it happens, several pretty creative ways do not require tons of cash to brand your company. And while it can necessitate an investment of time, the return on investment won't be noticed in some situations, and it can really help you save cash. Here is what you can do to brand your company:</p>

          <h2>Understand your personas</h2>
          <p>The behaviour of your prospective customers, aims, and the needs order how you share your products or services. Comprehending those things helps you discover what type of media your personas are using up, what inspires them, and where it resides. It's possible for you to see why having that info helps develop a robust, powerful brand that can help you reach the right folks.</p>
          
          <h2>Develop an identification and a voice</h2>
          <p>Your brand can start to take shape once you have identified your buyer personas. That calls for creating a brand identity, the things which make folks conscious of what the brand is, and his voice, which will be the tone you use within public communication or any copy.</p>
           
          <p>Finding that out follows a procedure, not unlike the one that is used to discover your personas. But instead of answering inquiries about your market, you are answering questions which can be a little more introspective to your brand. What's its worth? What does it signify? How do you need folks to talk about you?</p>
          
          <h2>Have a constant social network existence</h2>
          <p>It is important to determine where they are spending the most time, particularly on social media, since you might have a transparent image of the distinct bits of your audience. Pay close focus to the data. Perhaps the bulk of your characters spend most of their time on one network.</p>
           
          <p>It does give you a concept of where to devote the most resources while that does not mean you should disregard the others. And when you establish that existence, keep it. How often have you gone to the Facebook Page of a brand only to find that nothing has been posted in the past three months? Odds are, it did not have a favourable impact on your perception. Like you would with some other promotion calendar that can be prevented by diligently planning and scheduling social network posts. That plays an enormous part by sharing content that pertains to what they are probably thinking about at the confirmed time of year so that you remain important to your crowd.</p>
